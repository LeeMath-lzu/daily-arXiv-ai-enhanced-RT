When the 3-manifold has reduced holonomy, we present an algorithm to determine the dimension and the list of generators of the skein module with a general gauge group. The analysis uses a deformation preserving ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry to express the dimension as a sum over nilpotent orbits. We find that the dimensions often differ between Langlands-dual pairs beyond the A-series, for which we provide a physical explanation involving chiral symmetry breaking and 't Hooft operators. We also relate our results to the structure of $\\mathbb{C}^*$-fixed loci in the moduli space of Higgs bundles. This approach helps to clarify the relation between the gauge-theoretic framework of Kapustin and Witten with other versions of the geometric Langlands program, explains why the dimensions of skein modules do not exhibit a TQFT-like behavior, and provides a physical interpretation of the skein-valued curve counting of Ekholm and Shende."}

The existence of unities for the mode transition algebra of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 allows us to explicitly construct all higher level Zhu algebras of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2. We further analyze weak modules of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 induced from Zhu algebras, proving that every such module is already induced from the level-zero Zhu algebra.

We further show, without any assumption on the character of $V$ but assuming that $\\mathcal{C}$ is rigid, that $\\mathcal{C}$ is a factorizable finite ribbon category, that is, a not-necessarily-semisimple modular tensor category. As a consequence, we show that if the Zhu algebra of $V$ is semisimple, then $\\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple and thus $V$ is rational. The proofs of these theorems use techniques and results from tensor categories together with the method of Moore-Seiberg and Huang for deriving identities of two-point genus-one correlation functions associated to $V$. We give two main applications. First, we prove the conjecture of Kac-Wakimoto and Arakawa that $C_2$-cofinite affine $W$-algebras obtained via quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction of admissible-level affine vertex algebras are strongly rational. The proof uses the recent result of Arakawa and van Ekeren that such $W$-algebras have semisimple (Ramond twisted) Zhu algebras. Second, we use our rigidity results to reduce the \"coset rationality problem\" to the problem of $C_2$-cofiniteness for the coset. That is, given a vertex operator algebra inclusion $U\\otimes V\\hookrightarrow A$ with $A$, $U$ strongly rational and $U$, $V$ a pair of mutual commutant subalgebras in $A$, we show that $V$ is also strongly rational provided it is $C_2$-cofinite."}
