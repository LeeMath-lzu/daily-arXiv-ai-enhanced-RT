Further, we provide an explicit computable algorithm to determine the generalized GGP relevant pair, as developed in \\cite{Cha_qbl}. In particular, we show that if $π$ and $π'$ are any irreducible smooth representations of $\\mathrm{GL_{n+1}(F)}$ and $\\mathrm{GL_{n}(F)}$ respectively, and their Langlands data or Zelevinsky data are given in terms of multisegments, then through an algorithmic process we can determine whether the space $\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\mathrm{GL_n(F)}}(π, π')$ is non-zero. Finally, when one of the represntations $π$ and $ π'$ is a generalized Speh representation, we give a complete classification for the other one for which the Hom space is non-zero."}

The principal symbol in this calculus involves the unitary representations of a family of graded nilpotent groups. Not all the irreducible representations of these groups have to be taken into account however, the ones that should be considered form the Helffer-Nourrigat cone. This space thus plays the role of a phase space in subriemannian geometry. Its topology is however very singular, preventing any kind of geometry on it. We propose a way to desingularize it. The unitary spectrum of a nilpotent group can be stratified into strata that are locally compact Hausdorff, following Puckansky and Pedersen. We show how this stratification extends to the whole Helffer-Nourrigat cone. As a byproduct, we show that the C*-algebra of principal symbols and the one of pseudodifferential operators of order 0 are solvable with explicit subquotients."}

The first one, introduced by Solomon, extends the Hecke algebra to the full matrix monoid, yielding the rook monoid algebra. The second one, developed by Yokonuma, replaces the Borel subgroup with the unipotent subgroup, resulting in the Yokonuma-Hecke algebra. Our concrete algebra is constructed from the double cosets of the unipotent subgroup within the full matrix monoid. We show that this double coset decomposition is indexed by the framed symmetric inverse monoid. We also define the Rook Yokonuma-Hecke algebra as an abstract structure using generators and relations. We then prove the main isomorphism theorem, which establishes that this abstract algebra is isomorphic to the framed rook algebra under a specific parameter specialization. To complete our characterization, we provide a faithful representation on a tensor space and establish a linear basis for the Rook Yokonuma-Hecke algebra."}

We establish several fundamental structural results: scalar extensions preserve both the algebraic structure and simplicity; intermediate subalgebras associated with subgroups $\\ZZ \\subseteq \\cB \\subseteq \\cA$ remain simple; the algebra of graded derivations is isomorphic to a semidirect product $\\Weyl{e^{\\pm x^p e^{t}},\\; e^{\\cA x},\\; x^{\\cA}} \\rtimes \\FF^n$; tensor products over disjoint variable sets decompose naturally into larger algebras; and a complete isomorphism criterion is given, showing that isomorphism depends precisely on the orbit of the parameter $p$ under the automorphism group of $\\cA$ and the equality of the deformation parameter $t$. These theorems generalize classical results on Weyl and Witt algebras, provide new families of simple algebras, and offer a foundation for further research in deformation theory, representation theory, and cohomology."}

We first prove that the divergent terms on the geometric and spectral sides are equal, leading to their cancellation. We derive an explicit formula for ramified orbital integrals, showing they are limits of unramified ones and that Arthur's definition yields a universal object, agreeing with that of Hoffmann-Wakatsuki. Finally, on the spectral side, we apply normalized intertwining operators to present the expansion in a form parallel to that of the geometric side."}

S. Smith and H. Völklein (A geometric presentation for the adjoint module of $\\mathrm{SL}_3(\\mathbb{K})$, {\\em J.

They also give some information on the relatively universal embedding of $A_{2,\\{1,2\\}}(\\mathbb{K})$ which covers the natural one, but that information is not sufficient to exhaustively describe it. The \"if\" part of Smith-Völklein's result also holds true for any $n$, as proved by Völklein in his investigation of the adjoint modules of Chevalley groups (H. Völklein, On the geometry of the adjoint representation of a Chevalley group, {\\em J. Algebra}, vol. 127). In this paper we give an explicit description of the relatively universal embedding of $A_{n,\\{1,n\\}}(\\mathbb{K})$ which covers the natural one. In particular, we prove that this relatively universal embedding has (vector) dimension equal to $\\mathfrak{d}+n^2+2n$ where $\\mathfrak{d}$ is the transcendence degree of $\\mathbb{K}$ over its minimal subfield (if $\\mathrm{char}(\\mathbb{K}) = 0$) or the generating rank of $\\mathbb{K}$ over ${\\mathbb K}^p$ (if $\\mathrm{char}(\\mathbb{K}) = p > 0$). Accordingly, both the \"if\" and the \"only if\" part of Smith-Völklein's result hold true for every $n \\geq 2$."}

Furthermore, we extend this construction for higher analogues of representation finite and hereditary algebras. Specifically, if $M$ is an n-cluster tilting object in the bounded derived category of n-representation finite and n-hereditary algebra, then we construct a full subcategory in a canonical way, so that its endomorphism algebra is a higher Auslander algebra of global dimension $(n+2)k+n+1$ for any $k\\geq 1$.\n  As an application, we revisit the higher Auslander correspondence. Firstly, we describe the corresponding module categories that have higher cluster-tilting objects, and then we discuss their relationship with certain full subcategories of the derived category. Consequently, we obtain a vast list of n-representation finite n-hereditary algebras whose n-cluster tilting objects are always minimal generator-cogenerator. Moreover, resulting algebras can be realized as endomorphism algebras of certain full subcategories of (higher) cluster categories."}

While the relevant representations of the conformal algebra were recently worked out, it remained to determine the action of the global symmetry groups: the orthogonal group for the $O(n)$ model, and the symmetric group $S_Q$ for the $Q$-state Potts model.\n  We do this by two independent methods. First we compute the twisted torus partition functions of the models at criticality. The twist in question is the insertion of a group element along one cycle of the torus: this breaks modular invariance, but allows the partition function to have a unique decomposition into characters of irreducible representations of the global symmetry group.\n  Our second method reduces the problem to determining branching rules of certain diagram algebras. For the $O(n)$ model, we decompose representations of the Brauer algebra into representations of its unoriented Jones--Temperley--Lieb subalgebra. For the $Q$-state Potts model, we decompose representations of the partition algebra into representations of the appropriate subalgebra. We find explicit expressions for these decompositions as sums over certain sets of diagrams, and over standard Young tableaux.\n  We check that both methods agree in many cases. Moreover, our spaces of states are consistent with recent bootstrap results on four-point functions of the corresponding CFTs."}
