For a $V$-module $W = \\oplus W_d$, a sequence of associative algebras $\\mathfrak{A}_d$ acts on each graded component $W_d$. When these $d$th-mode transition algebras $\\mathfrak{A}_d$ are strongly unital - meaning they are unital with units acting as the identity on $W_d$ - the associated sheaves of conformal blocks are vector bundles rather than merely coherent sheaves. This strong unital property, while difficult to verify in practice, has other important implications as well. Here we construct explicit strong units for $L_{\\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}_2}}(1,0)$, the simple affine VOA for $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at level $1$, and establish that mode transition algebras for universal affine VOAs for $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ are never strongly unital at any level $k$ not equal to the critical level $-2$."}

We prove that the symplectic blob algebras are graded cellular and provide a conjectural algorithm for calculating their graded decomposition matrices. In doing so, we give the first explicit family of finite-dimensional graded quotients of the orientifold quiver Hecke algebras, providing a new entry point for the structure of these algebras -- in the spirit of Libedinsky--Plaza's ``blob algebra approach'' to modular representation theory."}

This is with an eye to applications in the representation theory of $\\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ for a $p$-adic field $F$ over coefficient rings in which $p$ is invertible but does not have a square root, which have been a topic of recent interest. This is achieved via a renormalisation of the known affine cellular structure over $\\mathbb{Z}\\left[q^{\\pm\\frac{1}{2}}\\right]$ at each left and right cell, which is chosen to ensure that the diagonal intersections remain subalgebras and that the left and right cells remain isomorphic. We furthermore show that the affine cellular structure on the Schur algebra has idempotence properties which imply finite global dimension, an important ingredient for the applications to representations of $p$-adic groups."}

We then apply this result to smash product algebras. Furthermore, the localization theory of module categories and triangulated module categories is investigated."}
