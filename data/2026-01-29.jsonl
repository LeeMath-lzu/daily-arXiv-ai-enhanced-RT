We develop a systematic study of this concept, including examples and applications. In particular, we show that geometric purity is, in general, strictly stronger than ordinary purity, and that it naturally leads to the notion of geometrically pure-injective objects. We prove that such objects arise as pushforwards of pure-injective objects from suitable tt-stalks. Moreover, we give a detailed analysis of indecomposable geometrically pure-injective objects in the derived category of the projective line. Under mild additional assumptions, we identify the geometric part of the Ziegler spectrum as a closed subset.\n  As an application, we demonstrate that this new notion of purity can be used to tackle the problem of spatiality of the frame of smashing ideals via the geometric Ziegler spectrum. In particular, we show that our approach rules out the counterexamples of Balchin and Stevenson to existing methods."}

We prove that under some restrictions, an alternating snake defines a canonical monoidal category. We prove that this category has finitely many prime objects. As a consequence we prove that the Grothendieck ring is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category $\\mathscr C_ξ$ for a suitable height function. In particular it follows that the special family of alternating snakes provides a monoidal categorification of a cluster algebra of type $A_N$ for a suitable value of $N$."}

This perspective allows us to interpret the action on g-vectors as a change of coordinates in the tropical setting. Focusing on Grassmannian cluster algebras, we analyse tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms in detail. We derive tropical analogues of the braid group action and the twist map on both g-vectors and tableaux. We introduce the notions of unstable and stable fixed points for quasi-automorphisms, which prove useful for constructing cluster monomials and non-real modules, respectively.\n  As an application, we demonstrate that the counts of prime non-real tableaux with a fixed number of columns in $\\mathrm{SSYT}(3, [9])$ and $\\mathrm{SSYT}(4, [8])$, arising from the braid group action on stable fixed points, are governed by Euler's totient function. Furthermore, we apply our findings to scattering amplitudes in physics, providing a novel interpretation of the square root associated with the four-mass box integral via stable fixed points of quasi-automorphisms of the Grassmannian cluster algebra $\\CC[\\Gr(4,8)]$."}

This notion generalizes $τ_{[d]}$-tilting pairs of extended finitely generated modules over finite-dimensional algebras to a more general framework, which includes both extended large modules over unitary rings and truncated subcategories of finite-dimensional derived categories of proper non-positive differential graded algebras. Within this setting, we establish a bijection between AIR tilting subcategories and silting subcategories. Furthermore, we define quasi-tilting and tilting subcategories of extended hearts, extending the corresponding notions from module categories, and investigate their fundamental properties along with the relationships among these tilting-related classes."}

The main conclusion that we want to bring out to contrast these two cases is that for reductive groups over finite fields, the dimension data is concentrated (in a statistical sense) in a neighborhood of the maximal dimension, whereas for the symmetric group, it is spread out."}

It is natural to ask if one can classify all such families. Indeed many classification results have been obtained in this direction, but only under the additional assumption that the polynomials are eigenfunctions of some second order operator.\n  In this paper we initiate a new approach to this classification. We propose a definition of an HG family that makes precise, but also generalizes, the notion of a ``hypergeometric'' family. Our main result is that there are exactly 10 types of orthogonal HG families, 8 from the well-known Askey scheme and 2 additional types of families that can be expressed in terms of Lommel polynomials.\n  Our methods in this paper are algebraic. In particular, we classify a wider class of quasi-orthogonal HG families, and this classification is valid over an arbitrary field of characteristic zero. We also define a more general class of rational HG families and prove a structure theorem for quasi-orthogonal families in this class. We provide examples for such families, that are in particular new families of orthogonal polynomials of potential interest."}
