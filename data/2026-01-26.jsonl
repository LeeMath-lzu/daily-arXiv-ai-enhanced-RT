Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride."}

No figures. Part of a six-paper series on Algebraic Phase Theory", "summary": "We develop the representation theory intrinsic to Algebraic Phase Theory (APT) in regimes where defect and canonical filtration admit faithful algebraic realisation. This extends the framework introduced in earlier work by incorporating a representation-theoretic layer that is compatible with defect and filtration. In this setting, algebraic phases act naturally on filtered module categories rather than on isolated objects, and classical irreducibility must be replaced by a filtration-compatible notion of indecomposability forced by defect.\n  As a central application, we analyse the Frobenius Heisenberg algebraic phase, which occupies a rigid boundary regime within the broader APT landscape, and show that it satisfies the axioms of APT in a strongly admissible form. We study the representations realising this phase and show that their non-semisimplicity and rigidity properties are consequences of the underlying algebraic structure rather than analytic or semisimple hypotheses. In particular, we establish a Stone von Neumann type rigidity theorem for Heisenberg groups associated with finite Frobenius rings. For each such ring $R$, we construct a canonical Schrödinger representation of the Frobenius Heisenberg group $H_R$, and show that, for a fixed nontrivial central character, every centrally faithful representation of $H_R$ is equivalent to this model.\n  The proof is entirely algebraic and uses no topology, unitarity, Fourier analysis, or semisimplicity. Instead, rigidity emerges as a boundary phenomenon governed by defect and canonical filtration. The Frobenius hypothesis is shown to be sharp: it precisely delineates the structural boundary within APT at which Heisenberg rigidity persists, and outside the Frobenius class this rigidity necessarily fails."}

We consider three different periods: linear periods, twisted-linear periods and Galois periods. Our criterion is a local-global principle, which is stated in terms of local distinction, a further local obstruction, and poles of certain global L-functions associated to the underlying involution via the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence. Our local-global principle follows from a new method, relying on the Maass-Selberg relations and a careful analysis of singularities of local and global intertwining periods. Our results generalize to inner forms, known results for split general linear groups. Moreover, our result for twisted linear periods is new even in the split situation. As a consequence of our local-global principle, we complete the proof of one direction of the Guo-Jacquet conjecture."}

This notion was originally introduced by Boltje, Danz and Külshammer in 2011, and it has been the subject of numerous papers in recent years. In this paper, we study the depth of core-free subgroups, which allows us to apply powerful computational and probabilistic techniques that were originally designed for studying bases for permutation groups. We use these methods to prove a wide range of new results on the depth of subgroups of almost simple groups, significantly extending the scope of earlier work in this direction. For example, we establish best possible bounds on the depth of irreducible subgroups of classical groups and primitive subgroups of symmetric groups. And with the exception of a handful of open cases involving the Baby Monster, we calculate the exact depth of every subgroup of every almost simple sporadic group. We also present a number of open problems and conjectures."}

The first one is a $rank\\ compression\\ system$ $ξ$ for a finite poset $\\mathbf{P}$ that assigns each interval subposet $I$ to an order-preserving map $ξ_I \\colon I^ξ \\to \\mathbf{P}$ satisfying some conditions, where $I^ξ$ is a connected finite poset.

The second one is an $I$-$rank$ of a persistence module $M$ under $ξ$, the family of which is called the $interval\\ rank\\ invariant$ of $M$ under $ξ$. A compression system $ξ$ makes it possible to define the $interval\\ replacement$ (also called the interval-decomposable approximation) not only for 2D persistence modules but also for any persistence modules over any finite poset. We will show that the forming of the interval replacement preserves the interval rank invariant, which is a stronger property than the preservation of the usual rank invariant. Moreover, to know what is preserved by the replacement explicitly, we will give a formula of the $I$-rank of $M$ under $ξ$ in terms of the structure linear maps of $M$ for any compression system $ξ$. The formula leads us to a concept of essential cover, which gives us a sufficient condition for the $I$-rank of $M$ under $ξ$ to coincide with that under another compression system $ζ$. This is applied to the case where $ξ= \\mathrm{tot}$, the value of $I$-rank under which is equal to the generalized rank invariant introduced by Kim--Mémoli, to give an alternative proof of the Dey--Kim--Mémoli theorem computing the generalized rank invariant by using a zigzag path."}

The reproducing kernels of these functions have an especially simple form: (Z-W)^{-1}. We describe the K-type bases of quasi regular functions and derive the reproducing kernel expansions. We also show that the restrictions of the irreducible representations formed from the quasi regular functions to the Poincare group have three irreducible components.\n  Our interest in the quasi regular functions arises from an application to the study of conformal-invariant algebras of quaternionic functions. We also introduce a factorization of certain intertwining operators between tensor products of spaces of quaternionic functions. This factorization is obtained using fermionic Fock spaces constructed from the quasi regular functions."}
