In particular, this yields a description of the Hochschild cohomology of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of surfaces in the sense of Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich which have at least one stop. Our results are an important ingredient in the author's recent description of the derived Picard group of partially wrapped Fukaya categories and graded gentle algebras. As another application we provide a characterisation of intrinsically formal graded gentle algebras under mild assumptions."}

Our primary result is a structural factorization of the transition matrix $C$ between the Mirković--Vilonen (MV) basis and the convolution basis into $C = P \\cdot M \\cdot A \\cdot Q^{-1}$, where the four factors represent: equivariant localization ($Q$), fusion via nearby cycles ($A$), local intersection cohomology stalks ($M$), and diagonal normalization ($P$). Utilizing this factorization, and by introducing the Geometric Efficiency metric ($η$) we establish a Universal Geometric Rank Bound, proving that the rank of the transition matrix $C$ is bounded by the dimension of the local Braden--MacPherson (BMP) stalks."}

In this paper, we focus mostly on the case of a unipotent Hopf algebra $A$. The stable category $\\underline{\\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\\mathsf{env}})$ of $A$-bimodules that are projective as left and as right $A$-modules is a monoidal triangulated category under $\\otimes_A$, and acts naturally on the stable category $\\underline{\\mathsf{mod}}(A)$ of $A$. We show in this case that the Balmer spectrum $\\mathsf{Spc}(\\mathcal{E})$ of the thick subcategory ${\\mathcal E}$ of $\\underline{\\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\\mathsf{env}})$ generated by $A$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathsf{Spc}(\\underline{\\mathsf{mod}}(A))$ and defines an embedding $\\mathsf{Spc}(\\underline{\\mathsf{mod}}(A)) \\to \\mathsf{Spc}(\\underline{\\mathsf{mod}}(A^{\\mathsf{env}}))$. Subject to a conjectural description of spectra of finite tensor categories, we show that the spectrum of ${\\mathcal E}$ is homeomorphic to ${\\mathsf{Proj}}$ of the Hochschild cohomology ring of $A$, and that the Hochschild support coincides with the universal Balmer support. We show that any subcategory ${\\mathcal K}$ of $\\underline{\\mathsf{lrp}}(A^{\\mathsf{env}})$ containing a thick generator admits a surjective continuous map from $\\mathsf{Spc}(\\underline{\\mathsf{mod}}(A))$. As a consequence, under the aforementioned conjecture, this spectrum is Noetherian, classifies the thick ideals of ${\\mathcal K}$, and classifies thick ${\\mathcal K}$-submodule categories of $\\underline{\\mathsf{mod}}(A)$ via the Stevenson module-theoretic support. As examples, we present in detail the representations of finite $p$-groups."}

A conformal twist is a square-zero odd element in the superconformal Lie algebra, and we classify all twists and describe their orbits under the adjoint action of the superconformal group. We work mostly with the complexified superconformal algebras, unless explicitly stated otherwise; real forms of the superconformal algebra may have important physical implications, but we only discuss these subtleties in a few special cases. Conformal twists can give rise to interesting subalgebras and protected sectors of operators in a superconformal field theory, with the Donaldson--Witten topological field theory and the vertex operator algebras of 4-dimensional N=2 SCFTs being prominent examples. To obtain mathematical precision, we explain how to extract vertex algebras and E_n algebras from a twisted superconformal field theory using factorization algebras."}
