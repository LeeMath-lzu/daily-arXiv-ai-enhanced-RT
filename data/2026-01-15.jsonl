If $B$ is a block of $kG$ with defect group $P$, we prove that the space of derivations on $kP$ which are restrictions of derivations on $kG$, modulo inner derivations, is isomorphic to a subspace of $\\operatorname{HH}^1(B,B)$. Using this, we provide various group theoretic criteria for the non-vanishing of $\\operatorname{HH}^1(B,B)$. In particular, we show $\\operatorname{HH}^1(B,B)\\neq 0$ for principal blocks having abelian defect group, for all blocks of the symmetric and alternating groups, for blocks of finite groups of Lie type in defining characteristic, and for blocks of general linear groups in any characteristic. Building on this, we show that if $k$ has prime characteristic $p>5$, and if $B$ is any block of $kG$ with Sylow defect group, then $\\operatorname{HH}^1(B,B)\\neq 0$. By the same method we also prove that if $k$ has prime characteristic $p>5$, then the first Hochschild cohomology group of any twisted group algebra is non-zero."}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "By the work of Hernandez-Leclerc, Leclerc-Plamondon, and Keller-Scherotzke, affine graded Nakajima quiver varieties associated with a Dynkin quiver $Q$ admit an algebraic description in terms of modules over the singular Nakajima category $\\mathcal{S}$ and a stratification functor to the derived category of $Q$. In this paper, we extend this framework to Nakajima's $n$-fold affine graded tensor product varieties, which allow one to geometrically realize $n$-fold tensor products of standard modules over the quantum affine algebra. We introduce a category of filtrations with splitting of length $n$ of modules over a category and show that it is equivalent to the module category of a triangular matrix category. Applied to the singular Nakajima category, this yields a category $\\mathcal{S}^{n\\operatorname{-filt}}$ whose modules are parametrized by the points of the $n$-fold tensor product varieties. Generalizing the results of Keller-Scherotzke from $\\mathcal{S}$ to $\\mathcal{S}^{n\\operatorname{-filt}}$, we prove that the stable category of finitely generated Gorenstein projective $\\mathcal{S}^{n\\operatorname{-filt}}$-modules is triangle equivalent to the derived category of the algebra of $n \\times n$ upper triangular matrices over the path algebra of $Q$, and we obtain a corresponding stratification functor."}

This result is obtained by constructing `change of category' isomorphisms of PExt groups across definable functors. The same isomorphisms illustrate circumstances when one can transfer the property of Brown--Adams representability. We demonstrate how these methods can be used to test whether certain derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves are a Brown category. We also make an investigation into the structure of derived categories of von Neumann regular rings, which are shown in many cases to control Brown--Adams representability; this includes a new proof of the telescope conjecture, and a new and short proof that a coherent ring satisfies Freyd's (strong) generating hypothesis if and only if it is von Neumann regular."}

We prove here that the integral semigroup algebra of a band is isomorphic to the integral path algebra of a quiver modulo an admissible ideal. This leads to a uniform bound quiver presentation for band algebras over all fields. Also, we answer a question of Margolis, Saliola and Steinberg by proving that the integral semigroup algebra of a CW left regular band is isomorphic to the quotient of the integral path algebra of the Hasse diagram of its support semilattice modulo the ideal generated by the sum of all paths of length two. This includes, for example, hyperplane face semigroup algebras."}

Combining the work of Beilinson-Drinfeld on D-modules and Hecke patterns with the recent work of the author with Dimofte and Py, we show that each of the above categories (more precisely the equivariant version) is monoidal equivalent to a localization of the DG category of modules of a graded Hopf algebra. As a consequence, we give an explicit braided monoidal structure to the derived category of D-modules on $G/G_{ad}$, which when restricted to the heart, recovers the braiding of Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg-Ostrik."}

Using this relation, we establish the multiplicativity identity of twisted matrix Kloosterman sums."}

In the process, we prove a case of the conjecture of Semikhatov-Tipunin, relating logarithmic CFTs to Nichols algebras of screening operators."}
