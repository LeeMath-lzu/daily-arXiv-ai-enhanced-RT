This perspective allows us to interpret the action on g-vectors as a change of coordinates in the tropical setting. Focusing on Grassmannian cluster algebras, we analyse tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms in detail. We derive tropical analogues of the braid group action and the twist map on both g-vectors and tableaux. We introduce the notions of unstable and stable fixed points for quasi-automorphisms, which prove useful for constructing cluster monomials and non-real modules, respectively.\n  As an application, we demonstrate that the counts of prime non-real tableaux with a fixed number of columns in $\\mathrm{SSYT}(3, [9])$ and $\\mathrm{SSYT}(4, [8])$, arising from the braid group action on stable fixed points, are governed by Euler's totient function. Furthermore, we apply our findings to scattering amplitudes in physics, providing a novel interpretation of the square root associated with the four-mass box integral via stable fixed points of quasi-automorphisms of the Grassmannian cluster algebra $\\CC[\\Gr(4,8)]$."}

Namely, given a Dynkin quiver $Q$, we consider the bounded homotopy category $\\mathcal{K}_Q^{(1)}$ of a symmetric monoidal category $\\mathcal{H}_Q^{(1)}$ that we define in terms of the Auslander-Reiten theory of $Q$. Using some iterated mapping cone procedure, we construct a distinguished family $\\{ C_{\\bullet}[β] \\}_{β\\in Δ_+}$ of chain complexes in $\\mathcal{K}_Q^{(1)}$ characterized (up to isomorphism) by homological conditions similar to those of higher exact sequences appearing in the context of higher homological algebra. We then prove that the distinguished triangle in $\\mathcal{K}_Q^{(1)}$ given by each mapping cone categorifies an exchange relation in the finite type cluster algebra $\\mathcal{A}_Q$ with initial exchange quiver $Q$ (for a suitable choice of frozen variables). As a consequence, we obtain that for each positive root $β$, the Euler characteristic of $C_{\\bullet}[β]$ coincides with the truncated $q$-character of the simple module $L[β]$ in the HL category $\\mathcal{C}_ξ^{(1)}$ categorifying the cluster variable $x[β]$ of $\\mathcal{A}_Q$ via Hernandez-Leclerc's monoidal categorification. Along the way, we establish a uniform formula for the dominant monomial of $L[β]$ in all types $A_n$ and $D_n$ for arbitrary orientations (agreeing with Brito-Chari's results in type $A_n$)."}

While the mathematics of general quantum states has been studied extensively, this article focuses specifically on their entanglement. When a quantum system varies over a classical parameter space, each fiber may look like the same Hilbert space, yet there may be no global identification because of twisting in the gluing data. Describing this situation by an Azumaya algebra, one always obtains the family of pure-state spaces as a Severi-Brauer scheme.\n  The main focus is to characterize the condition under which the subsystem decomposition required to define entanglement exists globally and compatibly, by a reduction to the stabilizer subgroup of the Segre variety, and to explain that the obstruction appears in the Brauer class. As a consequence, quantum states yield a natural filtration dictated by entanglement on the Severi-Brauer scheme.\n  Using a spin system on a torus as an example, we show concretely that the holonomy of the gluing can produce an entangling quantum gate, and can appear as an obstruction class distinct from the usual Berry numbers or Chern numbers. For instance, even for quantum systems that have traditionally been regarded as having no topological band structure, the entanglement of their eigenstates can be related to global geometric universal quantities, reflecting the background geometry."}
