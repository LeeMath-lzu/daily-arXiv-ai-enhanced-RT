Chen via his theory of iterated\nintegrals. We develop a relative version of Chen's model. Given a smooth map\n$f\\colon N\\to M$ between smooth manifolds, we consider the ``relative disk\nmapping space'' consisting of pairs $(\\Phi,\\gamma)$ of maps $\\Phi\\colon \\mathbb\nD\\to M$ and $\\gamma\\colon S^1\\to N$ such that $\\Phi|_{\\partial\\mathbb\nD}=f\\circ\\gamma$. We construct iterated integral models for this mapping space\nthrough an open-closed homotopy algebra (OCHA) naturally associated to $f$ and\nthe theory of open-closed Hochschild homology, which may be of independent\ninterest. Our main theorem states that the resulting map is a quasi-isomorphism\nwhen $M$ is contractible or 2-connected with the rational homotopy type of an\nodd sphere, and $N$ is simply connected. This result generalizes Chen's\nclassical theorem for free loop spaces and, in the above special cases, extends\nthe theorem of Getzler-Jones for double loop spaces."}

The Koszul dual of\n$U$, as defined by Positselski, is a curved dg-algebra. We establish an exact\nequivalence between the unbounded derived category of $U$ and an explicit\nquotient of the homotopy category of injective modules over the dual curved\ndg-algebra. This recovers a special case of a result of Positselski. In the\ncase where $U$ has finite global dimension, the quotient is trivial and hence\nthe unbounded derived category of $U$ is equivalent to the homotopy category of\ninjective modules over the dual curved dg-algebra."}

Employing this perspective, we introduce tropical principal\nbundles on metric graphs and study their explicit presentations as pushforwards\nof line bundles along covers with symmetries and extra data.
