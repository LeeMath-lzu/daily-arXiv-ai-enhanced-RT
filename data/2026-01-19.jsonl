The author with S. Trepode and A. G. Chaio introduced the notion of a Galois semi-covering functor to study the irreducible morphisms over skew group algebras. In this paper, we establish a Galois semi-covering functor between the morphism categories as well as the functor categories over the algebras A and AG and prove that their Krull-Gabriel dimension are equal. This computation confirms Prests conjecture on the finiteness of Krull-Gabriel dimension and Schroers conjecture on its connection with the stable rank (the least stabilized radical power) over skew gentle algebras. Moreover, we determine all posible stable ranks for (skew) Brauer graph algebras."}

Using the standard description of these objects as left-invariant flat algebraic connections on the trivial vector bundle, modulo algebraic gauge transformations, we recast the classification problem as an explicit moduli problem for constant connections.\n  Our main results treat the semisimple case and the general linear case. For a connected semisimple complex algebraic group $G$, we show that invariant $D$-modules of rank $n$ are determined by the finite central kernel of the simply connected cover of $G$: equivalently, their isomorphism classes are classified by $n$-dimensional complex representations of that finite group, up to conjugacy. For a general linear group, we prove that every invariant $D$-module of rank $n$ is obtained by pullback along the determinant map from the one-dimensional torus, so the classification reduces completely to the torus case."}

In 1966, Rothaus and Thompson studied whether the symmetric group $S_n$ with $n\\geq3$ admits a tiling $(T_n,Y)$, where $T_n$ consists of the identity and all the transpositions in $S_n$. They showed that no such tiling exists if $1+n(n-1)/2$ is divisible by a prime number at least $\\sqrt{n}+2$. In this paper, we establish a new necessary condition for the existence of such a tiling: the subset $Y$ must be partition-transitive with respect to certain partitions of $n$. This generalizes the result of Rothaus and Thompson, as well as a result of Nomura in 1985. We also study whether $S_n$ can be tiled by the set $T_n^*$ of all the transpositions, which finally leads us to conjecture that neither $T_n$ nor $T_n^*$ tiles $S_n$ for any $n\\geq4$."}
