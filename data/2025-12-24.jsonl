We prove that this occurs exactly when the algebra is locally representation-directed; a family of algebras introduced by Dräxler in the 1990s, which are always representation-finite. Then, we adopt a geometric perspective and analyze the brick and $τ$-regular components of module varieties. In this greater generality, we establish new properties of such components. Inspired by some recent conjectures, we apply our results to the study of minimal brick-infinite algebras. Along the way, we construct some limits of rigid $g$-vectors, under a condition that we call the $τ$-convergence property. This construction is novel and, in certain cases, yields an integral $g$-vector lying outside the $τ$-tilting fan (a.k.a. $g$-vector fan). We show how our results provide new tools to the study of some open conjectures and particularly illustrate that for $E$-tame algebras."}

When the underlying simple Lie algebra is of exceptional type, such a formula remains conjectural in many cases. Using a linear recurrence relation satisfied by the characters of KR modules, we convert the verification of a polyhedral formula into an identity between two rational functions of a single variable with only simple poles at known locations. It is then sufficient to compare the residues at those poles, which are explicitly computable quantities. By applying this strategy, we obtain new, computer-assisted and easily verifiable proofs of known polyhedral formulas in types $F_4$ and $G_2$ within a uniform framework."}
