The 4-manifold invariant has a simple description in terms of a diagrammatic calculus for this data, in which the three spherical fusion categories correspond to the three colours of the trisection diagram.\n  It includes the Hopf algebraic 4-manifold invariants by Chaidez, Cotler and Cui, which arise when the bimodule category is the category of finite-dimensional complex vector spaces.

In dimension two, oriented TQFTs are famously classified by commutative Frobenius algebras. In the unoriented setting, the classification requires additional data: an involution and a value assigned to the Möbius strip. In this work, we describe an intermediate framework that classifies 2-dimensional TQFTs for orientable cobordisms, in an appropriate sense. Our motivation arises from skein-theoretic models of surfaces embedded in 3-manifolds and Khovanov homology, where surfaces are often treated as unoriented, even though the associated 2-dimensional TQFTs themselves need not be fully unoriented."}

These surface skein modules have been first defined by Asaeda--Frohman and Kaiser using skein relations that generalize the combinatorics of Bar-Natan's dotted cobordisms. For 3-manifolds with boundary, we show that surface skein modules carry an action by a certain surface skein category associated with the boundary, which yields a gluing formalism. Our main result concerns a partial extension of $\\mathsf{AFK}_A$ to dimension 4, which uses an inductive state-sum construction following Walker. As an example, the equivariant version of Lee's deformation of dotted cobordisms yields a TQFT that extends to 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies but not 3-handlebodies. Finally, we characterize the attachment of 4-dimensional 2-handles by means of a certain Kirby color and use it to compute the invariants of 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies in examples."}

Moreover, stable equivalences of centralizer matrix algebras over perfect fields induce stable equivalences of Morita type, thus preserve dominant, finitistic and global dimensions. Our methods also show that algebras stably equivalent to a centralizer matrix algebra over a field have the same number of non-isomorphic, non-projective simple modules.

It is shown that if $G$ has a cyclic subgroup of index at most $2$, then the separating Noether number over $K$ of $G$ coincides with the Noether number over $K$ of $G$. The same conclusion holds when $G$ is the direct product of a dihedral group and the $2$-element group. On the other hand, the smallest non-abelian groups $G$ are found for which the separating Noether number over $K$ is strictly less than the Noether number over $K$. Along the way the exact value of the separating Noether number is determined for all groups of order at most $16$. The results show in particular that unlike the ordinary Noether number, the separating Noether number of a non-abelian finite group may well be equal to the separating Noether number of a proper direct factor of the group."}

Furthermore, the truncation pattern of the OPE coefficients suggests that the algebra cannot arise from the symmetric orbifold."}

Their algorithm only works for modules whose generators and relations are distinctly graded. We extend their approach to work on \\emph{all} finitely presented modules and introduce several improvements that lead to significant speed-ups in practice. Our algorithm is fixed parameter tractable with respect to the maximal number of relations with the same degree and with further optimisation we obtain an $O(n^3)$ algorithm for interval-decomposable modules. In particular, we can decide interval-decomposability in this time. As a by-product to the proofs of correctness we develop a theory of parameter restriction for persistence modules. Our algorithm is implemented as a software library \\textsc{aida} which is the first to enable the decomposition of large inputs. We show its capabilities via extensive experimental evaluation."}

Although we can prove neither fullness nor faithfulness at this point, we are able to show that the functor induces an isomorphism at the level of Grothendieck rings. We compute these rings and their canonical bases, and give diagrammatic descriptions of the corresponding primitive idempotents."}

Minor corrections have been made", "summary": "Unfolding singular points in linear differential equations is a classical technique for studying the properties of irregular singularities by relating them to regular singularities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$.\n  One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$.\n  Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution.\n  We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings. Our main result gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture."}
