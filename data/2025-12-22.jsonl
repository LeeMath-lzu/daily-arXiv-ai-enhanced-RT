Using a conjectural asymptotic behavior of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients we identify the corresponding Cuntz-Pimsner algebras with algebras of quantized functions on homogeneous spaces of $G$. We also show that the gauge-invariant part of the Toeplitz algebra provides a model for convergence of full matrix algebras to quantum flag manifolds, complementing and generalizing results of Landsman and Rieffel for $q=1$ and results of Vaes-Vergnioux in the rank one case for $q\\ne1$.\n  We verify our conjecture on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for $G=SU(n)$ and all weights that are either regular or multiples of the fundamental weight $ω_1$. For $λ=ω_1$, we also provide a detailed description of the Toeplitz and Cuntz-Pimsner algebras, generalizing results of Arveson on symmetric subproduct systems."}

In the non semisimple case related to the type B Lie algebras, the central subalgebra of Wheel Laurent polynomials is large enough to separate blocks of the BMW algebras."}

The symmetric space $S=GL(2p+1)/GL(p+1)\\times GL(p)$ (over a number field) is not cuspidal in the sense that its automorphic spectrum does not contain any cuspidal representation of $GL(2p+1)$. In this article, we compute the spectral decomposition of its relatively cuspidal part: this is, by definition, the part of the spectrum that is induced from the cuspidal part of the symmetric space $(GL(1)\\times GL(2p)) / (GL(1)\\times GL(p)\\times GL(p))$. As an application, we obtain the expression of the contribution of this relatively cuspidal part to the Guo-Jacquet trace formula (established by H. Li and the author) in terms of a weighted relative character."}

Other updates to literature and presentation throughout. v1: Comments welcome!", "summary": "We construct a relative version of the Crane-Yetter topological quantum field theory in four dimensions, from non-semisimple data. Our theory is defined relative to the classical $G$-gauge theory in five dimensions -- this latter theory assigns to each manifold $M$ the appropriate linearization of the moduli stack of $G$-local systems, called the character stack. Our main result is to establish a relative invertibility property for our construction. This invertibility generalizes the key invertibility property of the original Crane-Yetter theory which allowed it to capture the framing anomaly of the celebrated Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev theory. In particular our invertibilty statement at the level of surfaces implies a categorical, stacky version of the unicity theorem for skein algebras; at the level of 3-manifolds it equips the character stack with a canonical line bundle. Regarded as a topological symmetry defect of classical gauge theory, our work establishes invertibility of this defect by a gauging procedure."}

We modify the bases of these modules, as described by Elias, to obtain an orthogonal basis of each cell module. Hence, we calculate the determinant of the Gram matrix with respect to such bases.\n  These Gram determinants are given in terms of intersection forms, computed from certain traces of clasps - higher order Jones-Wenzl morphisms. Additionally, the modified basis is constructed using these clasps, and each clasp is constructed using traces of smaller clasps.\n  Elias conjectures a value for these intersection forms and verifies it in types $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$. This paper concludes with a proof of the conjecture in type $A_n$."}
