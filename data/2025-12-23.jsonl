In this paper, we present a large class of examples of pivotal module categories of topological origin: For a unimodular finite ribbon category $\\mathcal{A}$, we prove that the factorization homology $\\int_Σ\\mathcal{A}$ of a compact oriented surface $Σ$ with $n$ marked boundary intervals, at least one per connected component, comes with the structure of a pivotal module category over $\\mathcal{A}^{\\boxtimes n}$. This endows the internal skein algebras of Ben-Zvi-Brochier-Jordan, in particular the elliptic double, with a symmetric Frobenius structure. As application, we obtain, for each choice of $\\mathcal{A}$, a family of full open conformal field theories, each of which comes with correlation functions for all surfaces with marked boundary intervals that are explicitly computable using factorization homology. As a further application, we explain how modified traces can be 'integrated' over surfaces: We show that the modified trace for $\\mathcal{A}$ extends in a canonical way to the factorization homology of $Σ$. The resulting traces have the remarkable property of being modular invariant, i.e. fixed by the mapping class group action."}

Combined with Ikenmeyer's theorem on dominance and Kronecker positivity for staircases, this establishes that every 2-regular partition appears in the tensor square. Modular saturation then follows using only the diagonal entries $d_{μμ} = 1$ of the decomposition matrix, and the Bessenrodt--Bowman--Sutton lifting theorem completes the proof.\n  We further prove that at triangular numbers, staircases are the only Kronecker-universal self-conjugate partitions, providing a complete characterization."}

Furthermore, two points in C are equivalent if and only if they are related by a group of order 24 acting on C. There exists a set of 3 invariant polynomials that separates equivalence classes of 5-qubit AME states. We also show that every 4-qubit pure code is equivalent to a subspace of the unique ((4,4,2)) and construct an infinite family of 3-uniform n-qubit states for even $n\\geq 6$. The proofs rely heavily on results from Vinberg and classical invariant theory."}

These functors provide a categorification of Lusztig's braid group action on the quantum group. Similar functors were recently constructed independently by Kashiwara-Kim-Oh-Park via a different approach. Moreover, we prove that our reflection functors satisfy the braid relations as natural isomorphisms."}

The obtained irreducible modules for the Hamiltonian Lie algebra are cuspidal, whose weight multiplicities equal the dimension of the corresponding module of the symplectic Lie algebra. This extends well-known results for other Cartan type Lie algebras to the Hamiltonian case."}

To appear in Algebra & Number Theory", "summary": "We investigate the structure of the invariant subring of the tensor algebra $T(W)$ of a $G$-representation $W$, viewed as a twisted commutative algebra (tca). For a faithful representation $W$ of a finite group $G$ over a field $k$, we show that if char$(k) \\mid \\#G$, then $T(W)^G$ is not finitely generated as a tca. In contrast, for a representation $W$ of a classical group $G_{\\mathbb{Z}}$, we prove that the invariant subring $T(W_k)^{G_k}$ is finitely generated as a tca when $k$ is algebraically closed of sufficiently large characteristic, provided that $W$ admits a good filtration over $\\mathbb{Z}$. Finally, we introduce a categorical variant of the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension and compute its value to be $\\binom{n+1}{2}$ for $T(\\mathbb{C}^n)$ as a tca. Our key insight is to use the Schur functor to reduce questions about noncommutative invariants to those concerning vector invariants."}

If for every $g\\in G$, there are precisely $r$ pairs $(a,b)\\in A\\times B$ such that $g=ab$, then $B$ is called a code in $G$ with respect to $A$ and we write $r G=A\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}B$. If in addition $B$ is a subgroup of $G$, then we say that $B$ is a subgroup code in $G$. In this paper we resolve a conjecture by Green and Liebeck \\cite[Conjecture 2.3]{Green20} on certain subgroup codes in the symmetric group $S_n$. Let $n>2k$ and let $j$ be such that $2^j\\leqslant k<2^{j+1}$. Suppose that $X$ is a conjugacy class in $S_n$ containing $x$, and $Y_k$ is the subgroup $S_k\\times S_{n-k}$ of $S_n$, where the factor $S_k$ permutes the subset $\\{1,\\ldots,k\\}$ and the factor $S_{n-k}$ permutes the subset $\\{k+1,\\ldots,n\\}$. We prove that $r S_n=X\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}Y_k$ for some positive integer $r$ if and only if the cycle type of $x$ has exactly one cycle of length $2^i$ for $0\\leqslant i\\leqslant j$ and all other cycles have length at least $k+1$. We also propose several problems concerning the existence of certain subgroup codes in a finite group $G$ with respect to a conjugation-closed subset in $G$."}

Building on recent results relating middle convolution and finite complex reflection groups, our work implements Katz's middle convolution to explicitly classify finite orbits in the $SL_2(\\C)$-character variety of the punctured sphere. We provide theoretical results on the existence of finite orbits arising from the imprimitive finite complex reflection groups and formulas for constructing such examples when they exist. In the primitive finite complex reflection groups, we perform an exhaustive search and provide computational results. Our contributions also include Magma computer code for middle convolution and for computing the orbit under this action when it is known to be finite."}
