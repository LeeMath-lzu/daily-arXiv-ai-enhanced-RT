Under mild assumptions, we prove that the semiseparability of the induction functor is preserved if one applies a lax monoidal functor. Similar results are shown for the coinduction functors attached to coalgebra morphisms in a monoidal category. As an application, we study the semiseparability of combinations of (co)induction functors in the context of duoidal categories."}

In this paper we explore a higher-dimensional analogue of this theory, formulated with respect to the higher Auslander-Reiten translation $τ_d$. In particular, we associate to any functorially finite $d$-torsion class a maximal $τ_d$-rigid pair and a $(d+1)$-term silting complex. In the case $d=1$, the notions of maximal $τ_d$-rigid and support $τ$-tilting pairs coincide, and our theory recovers the classical bijections. However, the proof strategies for $d>1$ differ significantly. As an intermediate step, we prove that a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of a module category induces a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of the category of $(d+1)$-term complexes, producing novel examples of $d$-exact categories. We introduce the notion of a $d$-torsion class in the exact setup, and use this to obtain the aforementioned $(d+1)$-term silting complex. We moreover apply our theory to study $d$-APR tilting modules and slices. To illustrate our results, we provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of maximal $τ_d$-rigid pairs and $(d+1)$-term silting complexes for higher Auslander and higher Nakayama algebras."}

The situation in the non-commuting variables context is more complex; easily formed polynomial-like subrings can behave very oddly from the ambient ring.\n  We provide easy examples of a (semi)prime left Goldie skew polynomial ring of bijective type containing a monoid subring isomorphic to a free non-commutative polynomial ring. We then study the so-called subclass of \\emph{essentially special subextensions} and obtain for them the preservation of the uniform dimension and related concepts."}

While group algebras are known to be symmetric over any field, it is natural to ask whether this property extends to Hecke algebras. To study this, we introduce the new concepts of $p$-$S$-permutation groups (for a prime $p$) and $S$-permutation groups. A \\emph{ $p$-$S$-permutation group} is a transitive permutation group whose associated Hecke algebra is symmetric over every field of characteristic $p$. An \\emph{ $S$-permutation group} is a transitive permutation group that is a $p$-$S$-permutation group for all primes $p$. In this paper, we study Hecke algebras from a group-theoretical perspective and we show that several classes of permutation groups are $p$-$S$-permutation groups and $S$-permutation groups in our sense. This result represents a substantial extension of earlier work by Li and He. (Transform Groups, 30(4), 2025), and reframes the question of determining when the algebra \\(\\End_{KG}(KΩ)\\) is symmetric within a more general theoretical framework."}

In particular, we show that the coordinate algebra over odd-dimensional Vaksman-Soibelman quantum sphere can be realized as the Zhang twist of a Leavitt path algebra over a quiver with such relations. Furthermore, we show that the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, and Hecke condition for our RTT construction can be generated intrinsically from the adjacency matrix of certain quivers."}

For $k=1$ the combinatorial bases in both cases yield the two Capparelli identities and we wanted to see if there is a correspondence between the bases in terms of partitions for all $k\\in\\mathbb N$. By using the vertex operator relations in the principal picture for level $5$ standard $A_2^{(2)}$-modules we reduce a spanning set of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-type vectors in $L(5Λ_0)$ by removing the leading terms of relations and rendering a list of 34 ``difference'' conditions for partitions.We have with computer programs sorted out the sets of partitions satisfying these conditions and formed the partial generating series which agrees with the principally specialized character for all powers of $q$ up to $41$. Although our list of leading terms is incomplete, our results show that the corresponding combinatorial identity for $L_{A_2^{(2)}}(5Λ_0)$ drastically differs from the one for the Borcea dual $L_{A_1^{(1)}}(2Λ_0)$."}

We discuss useful properties such as injectivity, naturality and the relation with the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. Based on the image of the integration map we propose a candidate for the identity component of the derived Picard group in the case of finite-dimensional graded algebras. As a first application of the integration map it is shown that the vanishing of its domain is a necessary condition for the uniqueness of lifts of equivalences from the homotopy category to the A-infinity-level. The final part contains applications to derived Picard groups of wrapped and compact Fukaya categories of cotangent bundles and their plumbings and an outlook on applications to derived Picard groups of partially wrapped Fukaya categories after Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich."}

The first is the subalgebra of all degree zero elements and the second is the Dunkl angular momentum subalgebra. In this article, we study the ring-theoretic and homological properties of these algebras. Our approach is to realise them as rings of invariants under the action of certain reductive subgroups of $\\rm SL_2$. This allows us to describe their centres. Moreover, we show that they are Auslander-Gorenstein and Cohen-Macaulay and, at $t = 0$, give rise to prime PI-algebras whose PI-degree we compute. Since the degree zero subalgebra can be realized as the ring of invariants for the maximal torus $\\rm T \\subset SL_2$ and the action of this torus on the rational Cherednik algebra is Hamiltonian, we also consider its (quantum) Hamiltonian reduction with respect to $\\rm T$. At $t = 1$, the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the spherical subalgebra is a filtered quantization of the quotient of the minimal nilpotent orbit closure $\\overline{\\mathcal O}_{\\min}$ in ${\\mathfrak gl}(n)$ by the reflection group $W$. At $t = 0$, we get a graded Poisson deformation of the symplectic singularity $\\overline{\\mathcal O}_{\\min}/W$."}
