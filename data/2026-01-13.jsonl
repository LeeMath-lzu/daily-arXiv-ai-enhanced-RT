Among them is the De Concini-Kac form, which is the easiest to define but, perhaps, hardest to study. In this paper, we propose a suitable modification to the De Concini-Kac form, namely the even part algebra, which has some appealing features. Notably, it behaves uniformly with respect to the order of the roots of unity and admits an adjoint action of the Lusztig form. We revisit several results due to De Concini-Kac-Procesi and Tanisaki for the even part algebra. Namely, we give conceptual definitions of the Frobenius and Harish-Chandra centers and describe the entire center in terms of these two subalgebras getting a complete quantum analog of the Veldkamp theorem on the center of the universal enveloping algebras in positive characteristic. We investigate the Azumaya locus of the even part algebra over its center. We also show that the locally finite part of the even part algebra under the adjoint action of the Lusztig form is isomorphic to the reflection equation algebra, which is the quantized coordinate algebra with the product twisted by $R$-matrix. Some results on Lusztig forms at roots of unity are revisited and proved in greater generality including Kempf vanishing theorem and good filtrations on the quantized coordinate algebra."}

We prove here that the integral semigroup algebra of a band is isomorphic to the integral path algebra of a quiver modulo an admissible ideal. This leads to a uniform bound quiver presentation for band algebras over all fields. Also, we answer a question of Margolis, Saliola and Steinberg by proving that the integral semigroup algebra of a CW left regular band is isomorphic to the quotient of the integral path algebra of the Hasse diagram of its support semilattice modulo the ideal generated by the sum of all paths of length two.
