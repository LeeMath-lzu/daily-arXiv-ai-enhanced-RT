The main conclusion that we want to bring out to contrast these two cases is that for reductive groups over finite fields, the dimension data is concentrated (in a statistical sense) in a neighborhood of the maximal dimension, whereas for the symmetric group, it is spread out."}

Netay"], "title": "Series of quasi-uniform scatterings with fast search, root systems and neural network classifications", "comment": null, "summary": "In this paper we describe an approach to construct large extendable collections of vectors in predefined spaces of given dimensions. These collections are useful for neural network latent space configuration and training. For classification problem with large or unknown number of classes this allows to construct classifiers without classification layer and extend the number of classes without retraining of network from the very beginning. The construction allows to create large well-spaced vector collections in spaces of minimal possible dimension. If the number of classes is known or approximately predictable, one can choose sufficient enough vector collection size. If one needs to significantly extend the number of classes, one can extend the collection in the same latent space, or to incorporate the collection into collection of higher dimensions with same spacing between vectors. Also, regular symmetric structure of constructed vector collections can significantly simplify problems of search for nearest cluster centers or embeddings in the latent space. Construction of vector collections is based on combinatorics and geometry of semi-simple Lie groups irreducible representations with highest weight."}

We show that they always admit a natural Noetherian action of the completed graded ring R^ and that the categories of dualizable torsion and complete objects can be abstractly reconstructed as tensor-triangulated R^-linear categories from the category of compact torsions objects with the corresponding structure. If the category of compact objects of T in addition admits a strong generator g, we show that the torsion coreflection (resp. complete reflection) of g is a strong generator for the category of dualizable torsion (resp. dualizable complete) objects. In that case, we also show that the categories of dualizable torsion and compact torsion objects determine each other in terms of Brown-type representability theorems."}

This is a partial generalization and modification of Lue Pan's work in the modular curve case by using the works of Caraiani-Scholze, Koshikawa and Zou on mod $l$ cohomology of Shimura varieties. As applications, we prove the automorphy lifting theorem and the Breuil-M$\\mathrm{\\acute{e}}$zard conjecture in some $\\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathbb{Q}_{p^2})$ cases. We will assume a technical regularity condition on Serre weights of residual representations, but we don't assume any technical condition on the properties of liftings of residual representations at $p$-adic places except Hodge-Tate regularity. It should be noted that previously, such results were known only when we assumed that $F^+_v$ is equal to $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ for any $p$-adic place $v$ of $F^+$ so that we can use the $p$-adic Langlands correspondence of $\\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$. Moreover, we propose a conjectural strategy to prove such results in some $\\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathbb{Q}_{p^f})$ cases."}

One way to understand the construction is to introduce an intermediate algebra $AS(n,r)$, the degenerate affine Schur algebra, which appears both as the endomorphism algebra of an induced tensor space over $AH_r$, and as the image of a homomorphism $D_{n,r}:Y_n \\rightarrow AS(n,r)$. In this paper, we describe $D_{n,r}$ using a diagrammatic calculus. Then we use a theorem of Drinfeld to compute $\\ker D_{n,r}$ when $n > r$, thereby giving a presentation of $AS(n,r)$ in these cases. We formulate a conjecture in the remaining cases. Finally, we apply results of Arakawa to develop some of the representation theory of $AS(n,r)$."}

We give a geometric realization of this category as unipotently monodromic sheaves on the flag variety satisfying a singular support condition. We then explain that a derived version $\\mathcal{D}$ of this category is Koszul dual to the Kazhdan-Laumon Category O, a different enlargement of the BGG Category O obtained from a gluing construction for sheaves on the flag variety. This characterizes $\\mathcal{D}$ as the category of algebras over a natural monad on a direct sum of copies of the derived Category O. These results give new interpretations of classical algebraic constructions of weight modules over semisimple Lie algebras due to Fernando and Mathieu. We also conjecture that our results fit naturally into a proposed Koszul duality relating the small quantum group and the semi-infinite flag variety to the geometry of affine Springer fibers."}

In fact, they typically carry many such structures, the two best understood being the source-labelled and target-labelled structures, referring to how the initial cluster is computed from a Postnikov diagram or plabic graph. In this article, we show that these two cluster algebra structures quasi-coincide, meaning in particular that a cluster variable in one structure may be expressed in the other structure as the product of a cluster variable and a Laurent monomial in the frozen variables. This resolves a conjecture attributed to Muller and Speyer from 2017. The proof depends critically on categorification: of the relevant cluster algebra structures by the author, of perfect matchings and twists by the author with Çanakçı and King, and of quasi-equivalences of cluster algebras by Fraser and Keller. By similar techniques, we also show that Muller and Speyer's left twist map is a quasi-cluster equivalence from the target-labelled structure to the source-labelled structure."}
