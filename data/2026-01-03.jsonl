The complex representation theory of the Brauer and Temperley--Lieb algebras is now fairly well understood, with each connecting in a different way to Kazhdan--Lusztig theory. The semisimple representation theory of the KY algebras is also understood, and thus interpolates, for example, between the double-factorial and Catalan combinatorial realms. However the non-semisimple representation theory has remained largely open, being harder overall than the (already challenging) Brauer case. In this paper we determine generalised Chebyshev-like forms for the determinants of gram matrices of contravariant forms for standard modules.\n  This generalises the root-of-unity paradigm for Temperley--Lieb algebras (and many related algebras); interpolating in various ways between this and the `integral paradigm' for Brauer algebras.\n  The standard module gram determinants give a huge amount of information about morphisms between standard modules, making thorough use of the powerful homological machinery of towers of recollement (ToR), with appropriate gram determinants providing the ToR `bootstrap'. As for the Brauer and TL cases the representation theory has a strongly alcove-geometric flavour, but the KY cases guide an intriguing generalisation of the overall geometric framework."}

If $(β,β)=(α, β) = 0$, we show that $R_α(β)$ is bi-infinite and the multiplicities of $α+nβ$ are bounded. If $(β,β)=0$ and $(α, β) \\neq 0$, we show that $R_α(β)$ is semi-infinite and the muliplicity of $α+nβ$ or $α-nβ$ grows faster than every polynomial as $n\\to\\infty$. We also prove that $\\dim \\mathfrak{g}_{α+β} \\geq \\dim \\mathfrak{g}_α+ \\dim \\mathfrak{g}_β-1$ whenever $α\\neq β$ with $(α, β)<0$."}

We split the paper in two parts. This is the first part about Cartesian squares. The second part about multiplicative K-theory will appear in a subsequent preprint", "summary": "We introduce an abstract framework of Cartesian squares beyond the context of fiber products, and use it to extend the notion of pullback from classical to compact quantum principal bundles. Based only on our abstract notion of a Cartesian square, we extend key concepts of Equivariant Topology, such as the pullback of a family of group actions, orbit spaces, slices and global sections, change of base and structure group, free actions, and the groupoid of compact principal bundles. Finally, we embed the thus extended Equivariant Topology inside the 2-category of Grothendieck categories in such a way that our notion of a Cartesian square becomes the appropriate Beck-Chevalley condition."}
