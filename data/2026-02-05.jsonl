Comments welcome!", "summary": "We present a combinatorial model of configuration spaces and polytopes associated to the quotients of $\\mathbb{C} A_n$, the path algebra of the linearly oriented $A_n$ quiver, i.e. the algebra of upper triangular matrices. These quotient algebras are known as linear Nakayama algebras. Such configuration spaces were recently introduced for more general algebras by the second author and collaborators. In this special setting, we provide elementary proofs and explicit combinatorial constructions. From a Dyck path we define three related objects: a finite-dimensional algebra, an affine algebraic variety, and a polytope. Moreover, our constructions are natural: each relation in the poset of Dyck paths gives a morphism between the corresponding objects."}

Motivated by Okuda's classification of semisimple symmetric spaces admitting proper $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$-actions [J. Differ. Geom., 2013], we focus on a family of symmetric spaces lying on the \"boundary case\" of the existence of proper $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$-actions. As a rigidity result, we show that any connected non-compact semisimple Lie group acting properly on this family must be globally isomorphic to $Spin(n,1)$ up to compact factors. Moreover, the largest value of $n$ for the existence of $Spin(n,1)$-proper actions is governed by the Hurwitz-Radon number. Our family includes the pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic space $\\mathbf{H}_{+}^{N,N-1}$ of signature $(N,N-1)$."}

For general linear Lie superalgebras, Brundan--Stroppel constructed an infinite resolution of the so-called Kostant simple modules by Kac modules, but their construction does not directly generalize the classical BGG resolution.\n  In this paper we construct, for weights lying outside a neighborhood of the walls of the Weyl chambers, a resolution that categorifies a known Weyl-type finite-sum character formula in the same spirit as the Kac--Wakimoto formula. Our resolution is built from images of canonical homomorphisms between Verma modules attached to non-conjugate Borel subalgebras related by odd reflections. In particular, the construction developed here does generalize the classical BGG resolution."}

Loos"], "title": "On The Relative Cohomology For Algebraic Groups", "comment": null, "summary": "Let $G$ be an algebraic group over a field $k$, and $M$ and $N$ be $G$-modules. In 1961, Hochschild showed how one can define the cohomology groups $\\text{Ext}_{G}^{i}(M,N)$. Kimura, in 1965, showed that one can generalize this to get relative cohomology for algebraic groups. The original cohomology groups play an important role in understanding the representation theory of $G$, but the role of relative cohomology is still not well understood.\n  In this paper the author expands upon the work of Kimura to prove foundational results about the relative cohomology. The author starts by giving the definitions of relative exact sequences and relative injective modules and proves a variety of basic properties for each that will be essential to define relative cohomology and obtain a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence. In particular, the induction functor will play an important role when studying the relative injective modules. Once the necessary ground work is laid, the definition of relative cohomology is given. Finally, it is stated when there is a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence, and many consequences and examples are provided."}
