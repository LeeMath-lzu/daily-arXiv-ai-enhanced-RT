In this article, we study real-valued characters and real representations of the finite groups $\\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathfrak{o}_\\ell)$ and $\\mathrm{GU}_2(\\mathfrak{o}_\\ell)$. We give a complete classification of real and strongly real classes of these groups and characterize the real-valued irreducible complex characters. We prove that every real-valued irreducible complex character of $\\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathfrak{o}_\\ell)$ is afforded by a representation over $\\mathbb{R}$. In contrast, we show that $\\mathrm{GU}_2(\\mathfrak{o}_\\ell)$ admits real-valued irreducible characters that are not realizable over $\\mathbb{R}$. These results extend the parallel known phenomena for the finite groups $\\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $\\mathrm{GU}_n(\\mathbb{F}_q)$."}

All comments are welcome!", "summary": "We establish a Schur--Horn type inequality for symmetric hyperbolic polynomials. As an immediate consequence, we resolve a conjecture of Nam Q. Le on Hadamard-type inequalities for hyperbolic polynomials. Our argument is based on the Schur--Horn theorem, the Birkhoff theorem, and Gårding's concavity theorem for hyperbolicity cones. Beyond the eigenvalue level, we develop a symmetrization principle on hyperbolicity cones: if a hyperbolic polynomial is invariant under a finite group action, then its value increases under the associated Reynolds operator (group averaging). Applied to the sign-flip symmetries of linear principal minor polynomials introduced by Blekherman et al., this yields a short proof of the hyperbolic Fischer--Hadamard inequalities for PSD-stable lpm polynomials."}

Our approach is different from others in the literature in that there is no non-modularity assumption. We prove, when the field is algebraically closed, the analogue of the Main Theorem of the representation theory of Galois orders by V. Futorny and S. Ovsienko. Then we develop a theory of infinite rank generalized Weyl algebras, which was never explicitly introduced in the literature before, and prove its basic properties. We expect their representation theory to be of interest for future works. Finally we show that under very mild assumptions, the invariants of generalized Weyl algebras under the action of non-exceptional irreducible complex reflection groups are a principal Galois orders, greatly generalizing, in an elementary fashion, results obtained previously for the Weyl algebras."}

Inspired by it, we introduce the notion of a Kostant cuspidal permutation as a minimal Kostant negative consecutive pattern. It is shown that Kostant cuspidality is an invariant of a Kazhdan-Lusztig left cell. We describe four infinite families of Kostant cuspidal involutions, including a complete classification of Kostant cuspidal fully commutative involutions. In particular, we show that the number of new Kostant cuspidal elements can be arbitrarily large, when the rank grows. This provides some potential explanation why Kostant's problem is hard."}

We give a geometric realization of such cluster algebras by showing that cluster variables of $\\mathcal{A}$ correspond to $σ$-orbits of arcs of $\\tilde{\\mathbf{S}}$, while clusters are given by admissible $σ$-invariant triangulations. We establish a ring homomorphism from $\\mathcal{A}$ to a skew-symmetric cluster algebra of the same rank, which is combinatorially derived from $\\mathcal{A}$. We use this result to provide a cluster expansion formula for any $σ$-orbit $[γ]$ in terms of perfect matchings of some labeled modified snake graphs constructed from the arcs of $[γ]$. Then, we associate a symmetric finite-dimensional algebra $A$ to any seed of $\\mathcal{A}$, such that non-initial cluster variables bijectively correspond to orthogonal indecomposable $A$-modules. Finally, we exhibit a purely representation-theoretic map from the category of orthogonal $A$-modules to $\\mathcal{A}$, providing a Caldero-Chapoton map in this setting."}

Then the theory of $Sp_{2m}(\\mathbb{F}_p)$-invariant polynomials over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ may be applied to study the cohomology of $BPU(p^m)$, the classifying space of $PU(p^m)$.

This function arises in stable homotopy theory through the action of Steenrod squares on mod-$2$ cohomology and is closely related to the ghost length, which measures the minimal number of spheres required to construct a space up to homotopy. Building on the directed graphs $T_n$ introduced by Vakil to encode degree constraints for Steenrod operations, we interpret $f(n)$ as the length of the longest directed path starting at $n$. Using this framework, we resolve a question posed by Vakil by deriving concrete combinatorial formulas for $f(n)$ in terms of binary classes and a distinguished family of integers, which we call Vakil numbers."}
