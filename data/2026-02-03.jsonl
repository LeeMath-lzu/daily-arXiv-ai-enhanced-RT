For integral-level string functions the classical periodicity reduces the infinite sum of string functions in the generalized Euler identity to a finite sum of string functions with theta function coefficients. For admissible-level, we similarly reduce to an analogous finite sum of string functions, but we also gain an additional finite sum of the form \\begin{equation*} \\sum_{i}Φ_{i}(q)Ψ_{i}(q), \\end{equation*} where the $Φ_i(q)$'s are modular and depend only on the spin and the $Ψ_{i}(q)$'s are (mixed) mock modular Hecke-type double-sums and depend only on the quantum number.

This makes the zoo of different existing versions of quantum groups more transparent and allows the construction of many more non-semisimple modular tensor categories.

As an easy application, the formula enables us to compute the maximal interval-decomposable direct summand of $M$, which gives us a way to decide whether $M$ is interval-decomposable or not. In addition, when a set $V_{I_1}, \\dots, V_{I_n}$ of interval direct summands of $M$ gives a specific property of $M$, we can study this property by directly computing the multiplicities $d_M(V_{I_i})$ by our formula without decomposing $M$. Moreover, the formula tells us which morphisms of $\\mathbf{P}$ are essential to compute the multiplicity $d_M(V_I)$. This suggests us some order-preserving map $ζ\\colon Z \\to \\mathbf{P}$ such that the induced restriction functor $R \\colon \\operatorname{mod} \\mathbf{P} \\to \\operatorname{mod} Z$ has the property that the multiplicity $d:= d_{R(M)}(R(V_I))$ is equal to $d_M(V_I)$. In this case, we say that $ζ$ essentially covers $I$. If $Z$ can be taken as a poset of Dynkin type $\\mathbb{A}$, also known as a zigzag poset, then the calculation of the multiplicity $d$ can be done more efficiently, starting from the filtration level of topological spaces. Thus this even makes it unnecessary to compute the structure linear maps of $M$. Finally, we also give a formula of $d_M(V_I)$ in terms of a projective presentation of $M$ rather than its structure linear maps. In the 2D-grid case, this formula is more practical because in that case projective resolutions of $M$ can be computed from the filtration level of topological spaces."}

To characterize simple modules over affine Lie (super)algebras, it is necessary to study the cases of nonzero and critical levels separately. Although a vast amount of research has been done on the representation theory of affine Lie (super)algebras $\\LL$, investigations concerning general modules at the critical level remain limited. In all existing studies, the characterization of the modules under consideration is reduced to the characterization of modules over some subalgebras of $\\LL$. Depending on the structure of the original modules, these subalgebras -- and the corresponding modules -- have different natures some of which are already known, while others need to be studied separately. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of the modules over specific subalgebras $\\gG$ of a twisted affine Lie superalgebra $\\LL$ that arise in the study of general zero level simple finite weight $\\LL$-modules. In particular, in the special case that $\\gG=\\LL,$ we obtain a complete characterization of quasi-integrable $\\LL$-modules of level zero."}

Doing so requires analogous results for Fourier transforms of orbital integrals on the Lie algebra of a reductive group, which are of independent interest."}
