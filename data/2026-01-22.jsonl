Comments are welcome", "summary": "Given finite groups $H \\leq G$, a representation $σ$ of $G$ is called center-preserving on $H$ if the only elements of $H$ that become central under $σ$ are those that were already central in $G$. We prove that if $H$ has a faithful irreducible representation $ρ$, then at least one of the irreducible components of the induction $\\operatorname{Ind}_H^G(ρ)$ is center-preserving on $H$. In consequence, $H$ has a faithful irreducible representation if and only if every finite group $G$ containing $H$ as a subgroup has an irreducible representation whose restriction to $H$ is faithful, and which is center-preserving on $H$. In addition, we give examples illustrating the sharpness of the statement, and discuss the connection with projective representations."}

As an application, we recover and extend conditions under which modules over Hopf monads and Hopf algebroids inherit Grothendieck-Verdier structures. We also characterize when categories of bimodules, modules, and local modules over (commutative) algebras internal to a Grothendieck-Verdier category admit such structures. Our results apply to quantales, smash product algebras, skew group algebras, and enveloping algebras of Lie-Rinehart algebras.\n  For applications of the lifting theorem, we construct a strict $2$-equivalence between a $2$-category of Grothendieck-Verdier categories and one of linearly distributive categories with negation, and extend this $2$-equivalence to the braided setting."}

This could seem an element of art, but in the context of ADHM-like equations describing quiver varieties there is a systematic approach. In this note we study moduli spaces and dualities of quiver gauge theories associated to effective dynamics of D-branes compactified on Calabi-Yau resolutions. We concentrate on a subfamily of quivers $\\mathfrak{Q}_{\\mathfrak{g}}$ covering Dynkin diagrams for simple Lie algebras $\\mathfrak{g}$, where the respective BPS algebra is expected to be the Yangian algebra $Y(\\mathfrak{g})$. For Yangians labeled by quivers their representations are described by solutions of ADHM-like equations. As quivers substitute Dynkin diagrams a generalization of the Weyl group $\\mathcal{W}_{\\mathfrak{g}}$ acts on the ADHM solutions. Here we work with the case $\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ and treat this group as a group of electro-magnetic Seiberg-like dualities (we call them Weyl mutations) on the respective quiver gauge theories. We lift it to the case of higher representations associated to rectangular Young diagrams. An action of Weyl mutations on the BPS Yangian algebra is also discussed."}

We prove this correspondence in the cases associated to the group $\\mathrm{PSL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$, and Riemann surfaces of genus zero with a number of punctures larger than three. A crucial ingredient is a unitary integral transformation mapping products of solutions to the ordinary differential equation associated to a real oper to eigenfunctions of the quantised Hitchin Hamiltonians. This allows us to construct joint eigenfunctions of Hecke operators and Hitchin Hamiltonians from real opers."}

Altuğ studied $\\mathsf{GL}_2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ in the unramified setting. The first step involves isolating specific representations, especially the residual part of the spectral side, in the elliptic part of the geometric side of the trace formula. We generalize this step to the case with ramification at $S=\\{\\infty,q_1,\\dots,q_r\\}$ with $2\\in S$, thereby fully resolving the problem of isolating these representations over $\\mathbb{Q}$ which remained unresolved for over a decade. Such a formula that isolates the specific representations is derived by modifying Altuğ's approach. We use the approximate functional equation to ensure the validity of the Poisson summation formula. Then, we compute the residues of specific functions to isolate the desired representations."}
