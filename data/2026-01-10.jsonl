Our definition, which does not assume the boundary map to be continuous, encompasses many generalizations of positive or Anosov representations that have been considered in the literature."}

We give an inductive description of this cone, followed by an example of refinement of the inequalities characterising anti-invariant weights in the case of a quiver equipped with an involution."}
