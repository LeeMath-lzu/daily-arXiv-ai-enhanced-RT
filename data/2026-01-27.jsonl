We then prove the existence of weight bases in tensor products by explicitly constructing some highest weight vectors. These constructions allow us to mimic the important aspects of the classical finite dimensional representation theory.

Bondal introduced a symplectic groupoid of triangular bilinear forms. This induces the Poisson structure on $\\mathcal{A}_n$, the space of $n \\times n$ unipotent upper-triangular matrices. L. Chekhov and M. Shapiro described log-canonical coordinates on this symplectic groupoid via the $\\mathcal{A}_n$-quiver. In this paper, we introduce a birational Weyl group action on the symplectic groupoid. It is generated by cluster transformations associated with certain cycles of the quiver. We prove that every matrix entry of $\\mathcal{A}_n$ is invariant under this action. Conversely, we prove that matrix entries generate the Poisson subalgebra of Weyl group invariants in the ring of regular functions on the cluster variety $\\mathcal X_{|\\mathcal A_n|}$.\n  V. Fock and L. Chekhov defined a Poisson map $φ_n$ from the Teichmüller space $\\mathcal{T}_{g,s}$ with genus $g$ and $s \\in \\{1,2\\}$ boundary components into $\\mathcal{A}_n$. We aim to describe the cluster structure of $\\text{Im}(φ_n)$ by applying a Hamiltonian reduction to $\\mathcal A_n$. Since every element in $\\text{Im}(φ_n)$ satisfies the rank condition $\\text{rank}(A+A^T) \\le 4$, it provides a natural criterion for our Hamiltonian reduction. The solution set of the rank condition has distinct irreducible components, so the reduction might be component-dependent. However, we show that the Weyl group acts transitively on these components. This implies that the Hamiltonian reductions are conjugate; thus, it suffices to determine the reduction on a single component.\n  Furthermore, we prove that the longest element of the Weyl group corresponds to a cluster DT-transformation on the $\\mathcal{A}_{2k}$-quiver. In contrast, we show that no reddening sequence exists for odd $n$."}
