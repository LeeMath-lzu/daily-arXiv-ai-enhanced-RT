The Hall algebra constructions of $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{U}}$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{U}}^\\imath$ are given by Bridgeland and Lu--Wang, respectively. In this paper, we construct a Hall algebra framework for the coideal subalgebra structure of $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{U}}^\\imath$ in $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{U}}$, and for the quantum symmetric pair $(\\widetilde{\\mathbf{U}},\\widetilde{\\mathbf{U}}^\\imath)$. As an application, we prove that the natural embedding $\\imath:\\widetilde{\\mathbf{U}}^\\imath\\to \\widetilde{\\mathbf{U}}$, and the coproduct $Δ:\\widetilde{\\mathbf{U}}^\\imath\\to \\widetilde{\\mathbf{U}}^\\imath\\otimes \\widetilde{\\mathbf{U}}$ preserve the integral forms of $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{U}}^\\imath$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{U}}$, which are used to construct the dual canonical bases."}

It is obtained through a detailed study of the degenerate cyclotomic Hecke algebra. In particular, we prove that the fused permutations algebra is a quotient of the degenerate cyclotomic affine Hecke algebra, and we also describe a basis combinatorially in terms of signed permutations with avoiding patterns. In order to understand this quotient, we study the primitive idempotents of this degenerate cyclotomic affine Hecke algebra."}

Dedicated to the memory of Christine Bessenrodt", "summary": "Saxl's conjecture (2012) asserts that for the staircase partition $ρ_k = (k, k-1, \\ldots, 1)$, the tensor square of the corresponding irreducible representation of the symmetric group $S_{T_k}$ contains every irreducible representation as a constituent, where $T_k = k(k+1)/2$ is the $k$th triangular number. We prove this conjecture unconditionally.\n  Our proof introduces the Staircase Minimality Theorem: among all 2-regular partitions of $T_k$, the staircase $ρ_k$ is the unique dominance-minimal element. Combined with Ikenmeyer's theorem on dominance and Kronecker positivity for staircases, this establishes that every 2-regular partition appears in the tensor square. Modular saturation then follows using only the diagonal entries $d_{μμ} = 1$ of the decomposition matrix, and the Bessenrodt--Bowman--Sutton lifting theorem completes the proof.\n  We further prove that at triangular numbers, staircases are the only Kronecker-universal self-conjugate partitions, providing a complete characterization."}

Furthermore, we show that even-dimensional ball quotients, associated with arithmetic subgroups of $\\mathrm{U}(1,n)$ defined over $E$, are always of general type if $n > 207$, or $n>12$ and $D>2557$. To establish these results, we construct a nontrivial full-level cusp form of weight $n$ on the $n$-dimensional complex ball. A key ingredient in our proof is the use of Arthur's multiplicity formula from the theory of automorphic representations."}

We extend many of Sam--Snowden's far-reaching results from characteristic zero to this setting. For example, while the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of a finitely generated GL-equivariant $S$-module need not be finite in positive characteristic, we show that the resolution still has finitely many \"linear strands of higher slope\".\n  The crux of this paper is two technical results. The first is an extension to positive characteristic of Snowden's recent linearization of Draisma's embedding theorem which we use to study the generic category of $S$-modules. The second is a Nagpal-type \"shift theorem\" about torsion $S$-modules for which we introduce certain categorifications of the Hasse derivative. These two results together allow us to obtain explicit generators for the derived category. In a follow-up paper, we also use these results to prove finiteness results for local cohomology modules."}
