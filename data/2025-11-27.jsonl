It is well known that the Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of the Lie algebra $sl_2$ are given in terms of the dual Hahn polynomials. Taking the reversed point of view, we show that any finite dimensional family of polynomials belonging to the Askey scheme can be interpreted as Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of an algebra. The Hahn polynomials are thus associated to the oscillator algebra with the Krawtchouk polynomials treated through a limit. The dual Hahn polynomials and Racah polynomials are seen to be associated to $sl_2$ with a more general coproduct than the standard one. The $q$-Hahn polynomials are interpreted as Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of a $q$-deformation of the oscillator algebra and the $q$-Racah polynomials are seen to be connected in this way to $U_q(sl_2)$ with a generalized coproduct."}

These are a mainstay of solvable lattice models. We will show how the parameter space can sometimes be enlarged to a groupoid, and give two examples of such groupoid parametrized Yang-Baxter equations, within the six vertex model. A groupoid parametrized Yang-Baxter equation consists of a groupoid $\\mathfrak{G}$ together with a map $π:\\mathfrak{G}\\to\\operatorname{End}(V\\otimes V)$ for some vector space $V$ such that the Yang-Baxter commutator $[[ π(u),π(w),π(v)]]=0$ if $u,v\\in\\mathfrak{G}$ are such that the groupoid composition $w=u\\star v$ is defined. An important role is played by an object map $Δ:\\mathfrak{G}\\to M$ for some set $M$ such that $Δ(u)=Δ(v')$, $Δ(w)=Δ(v)$ and $Δ(w')=Δ(u')$, where $v\\mapsto v'$ is the groupoid inverse map.\n  There are two main regimes of the six-vertex model: the free-fermionic point, and everything else. For the free-fermionic point, there exists a parametrized Yang-Baxter equation with a large parameter group $\\operatorname{GL}(2)\\times\\operatorname{GL}(1)$. For non-free-fermionic six-vertex matrices, there are also well-known (group) parametrized Yang-Baxter equations, but these do not account for all possible interactions. Instead we will construct a groupoid parametrized Yang-Baxter equation that accounts for essentially all possible Yang-Baxter equations in the six-vertex model. We will also exhibit a separate groupoid for the five-vertex model. We will show how to construct solvable lattice models based on groupoid parametrized Yang-Baxter equations."}

Our definition allows Frobenius forms valued in objects other than the unit object, and can be seen as a categorical version of Frobenius extensions of the second kind. When the monoidal category is pivotal we define a Nakayama morphism for the Frobenius structure and explain what it means for this morphism to have finite order.\n  Our main example is a well-studied algebra object in the (additive and idempotent completion of the) Temperley-Lieb category at a root of unity. We show that this algebra has a Frobenius structure and that its Nakayama morphism has order 2. As a consequence, we obtain information about Nakayama morphisms of preprojective algebras of Dynkin type, considered as algebras over the semisimple algebras on their vertices."}
