We define and study a diagrammatic monoidal $\\mathbb{k}$-linear supercategory $\\mathbf{Web}^{aff}_{A}$ associated to any locally unital Frobenius $\\mathbb{k}$-superalgebra $A$. This category can be viewed variously as an affinization of the finite web category $\\mathbf{Web}_{A}$ previously defined by the authors and Zhu, as a thickening of the degenerate affine wreath product algebras defined by Savage, or as a Frobenius deformation of affine web categories defined by Song and Wang. We show that there is an asymptotically faithful family of functors from $\\mathbf{Web}^{aff}_{A}$ to the monoidal supercategory of endofunctors of $\\mathfrak{gl}_n(A)$-modules for every $n \\geq 1$, and use this to establish a basis of `decorated double coset diagrams' for morphism spaces in $\\mathbf{Web}^{aff}_{A}$. We also define and establish basis results for the cyclotomic quotient category $\\mathbf{Web}^Λ_{A}$ associated with a cyclotomic datum $Λ$."}

We prove that the homotopy category of $n$-fold matrix factorizations of $ω$, denoted ${\\rm HFact}_{n}(\\mathcal{A},T,ω)$, admits a natural structure of a right triangulated category. In particular, when $T$ is an automorphism, the homotopy category ${\\rm HFact}_{n}(\\mathcal{A},T,ω)$ becomes triangulated. Furthermore, if $\\mathcal{A}$ is a Frobenius exact category and $T$ is an autoequivalence, we obtain that the category ${\\rm Fact}_{n}(\\mathcal{A},T,ω)$ of $n$-fold $(\\mathcal{A},T)$-factorizations of $ω$ is a Frobenius exact category.

We consider the action of SL$(8,\\mathbb{R})$ on $\\bigwedge^4 \\mathbb{R}^8$ and classify the nilpotent and semisimple orbits as well as the Cartan subspaces.

For example, Terwilliger defined a universal $SL_2$ spherical double affine Hecke algebra $A$; a combination of results in the literature shows $A$ is isomorphic to the $SL_2$ skein algebra of the punctured torus.\n  Stated skein algebras are a generalization which quantize decorated character varieties. In this paper, we used stated skein algebras to construct a new embedding of $A$ into a rank 6 quantum torus, and we show that each marked 3-manifold with a torus boundary produces a module over $A$. We also determine a generating set for the stated skein algebra of $T^2\\setminus D^2$, and we find many relations; however, finding a complete list of relations is still an open problem."}

This homology admits a natural ring structure and a Schubert basis, giving rise to a well-defined Schubert calculus. We realize $H_*^T(\\mathrm{Gr}_G)$ in terms of symmetric functions. Our first main result introduces a new family of symmetric functions, called the \\emph{dual affine Schur $P$-functions}, which represent the Schubert classes. These functions are defined through the action of the affine nil-Hecke algebra, and specialize, in the stable limit as $n\\to \\infty$, to the dual factorial $P$-functions of Nakagawa and Naruse. Our second main result gives a precise comparison between this symmetric function model and the geometric construction of $H_*^T (\\mathrm{Gr}_G)$ due to Ginzburg and Peterson, which identifies it with a coordinate ring of a centralizer family in the Langlands dual group."}

In this paper, we investigate two useful methods to obtain some irreducible representations that occur in this decomposition. Our main tolls are the semi-group property for Kronecker coefficients and generalized blocks of symmetric groups."}

Our definition allows Frobenius forms valued in objects other than the unit object, and can be seen as a categorical version of Frobenius extensions of the second kind. When the monoidal category is pivotal we define a Nakayama morphism for the Frobenius structure and explain what it means for this morphism to have finite order.\n  Our main example is a well-studied algebra object in the (additive and idempotent completion of the) Temperley-Lieb category at a root of unity. We show that this algebra has a Frobenius structure and that its Nakayama morphism has order 2. As a consequence, we obtain information about Nakayama morphisms of preprojective algebras of Dynkin type, considered as algebras over the semisimple algebras on their vertices."}
