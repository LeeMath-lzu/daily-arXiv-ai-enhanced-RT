They arise from equations capturing a generalization of valuated symmetric basis exchange for Coxeter matroids. In particular, we study subdivisions of the associated Coxeter matroid polytopes. We show that the subdivisions induced by points of the Coxeter Dressian consist of cells which are strong Coxeter matroidal. This generalizes well-known results in type $A$ to other Lie types. Finally, we implement explicit computations of Coxeter Dressians in OSCAR."}

In this paper, we prove that, for types $ADE$, some of these categories provide monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras of affine type. Moreover, by means of the combinatorial theory of affine type cluster algebras, we give a complete classification of real and imaginary simple modules in these categories. In particular, we show that, in these cases, the conjecture asserting that real simple modules correspond exactly to cluster monomials holds."}

In particular, we are interested in the preprojective category over an open, bounded subinterval $\\mathbb{I}$ of $\\mathbb{R}$, denoted $Λ_{\\mathbb{I}}$. We study the representable projective modules and define a useful type of sub- and quotient module called decorous modules. These are completely described by a function from the closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{I}}$ of $\\mathbb{I}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ whose 'slopes' are not too steep anywhere. We later use these to describe permuton ideals, a generalization of the support $τ$-tilting ideals of preprojective algebras of type $A_n$, which we call permutation ideals. Once we have our generalization, we show that permutation ideals can be recovered from permuton ideals. Moreover, permutation ideals are $τ$-rigid and we show an analogous property for our permuton ideals. Along the way, we classify all the brick $Λ_{\\mathbb{I}}$-modules."}

Our main results establish: (1) the automorphism group of $R_{p,t,\\mathcal{A}}$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{F}^{\\times})^{2r+1} \\rtimes \\operatorname{GL}(2r+1,\\mathbb{Z})$; (2) a Galois descent theorem showing that fixed-point subalgebras under finite Galois actions recover the original Weyl-type algebra; (3) the non-existence of finite-dimensional simple modules for $A_{p,t,\\mathcal{A}}$; (4) the Zariski density of isomorphism classes in moduli spaces as transcendental parameters vary; (5) the stability of simplicity under generic quantum deformation; and (6) a complete representation-theoretic framework including the classification of irreducible weight modules, the construction of Harish--Chandra modules with BGG-type resolutions, and the structure of category $\\mathcal{O}$. These results unify and extend classical theories of Weyl algebras, Witt algebras, and generalized Weyl algebras, while opening new directions in deformation theory, non-commutative geometry, and the representation theory of infinite-dimensional algebras."}

In this article, we prove in all affine types that their conjectural Caldero-Chapoton type formula on these modules coincide with the Laurent expression of cluster variables. By taking generic Caldero-Chapoton functions on varieties of modules of finite projective dimension, we obtain bases for affine type cluster algebras with full-rank coefficients containing all cluster monomials."}

A substantial appendix on Morse-Bott-Floer theory deals with several of the technical difficulties of the paper.

In particular, we obtain a family of filtrations on singular cohomology for any Conical Symplectic Resolution, that is sensitive to the choice of $\\mathbb{C}^*$-action. The symplectic form is rarely exact at infinity for these spaces, so substantial foundational work is carried out to rigorously define Floer theory, in particular symplectic cohomology. Using Floer theory, we construct a periodic persistence module, giving rise to a graded periodic barcode associated to the $\\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This encodes birth-death phenomena of Floer invariants. Our filtrations can be viewed as a Floer-theoretic analogue of Atiyah-Bott filtrations, arising from stratifying a manifold by gradient flowlines of a Morse-Bott function, but they are distinct from those and they can detect non-topological properties of the quantum product."}
