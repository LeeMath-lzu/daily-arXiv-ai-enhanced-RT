In particular we focus on representations on $\\operatorname{M}_2(D)$ where $D$ is a division algebra having an order $\\mathcal{O}$ such that $\\mathcal{O}$ has finitely many units, i.e. such that $\\operatorname{SL}_2(\\mathcal{O})$ has arithmetic rank $1$. In this first part, the focus is on two aspects.\n  One aspect concerns characterisations of such representing spaces in terms of Serre's homological goodness property, small virtual cohomological dimension and higher Kleinian-type embeddings. As an application, we obtain several characterisations of the finite groups $G$ whose irreducible representations are of the mentioned form. In particular, such groups $G$ are precisely those such that $\\mathcal{U}(R G)$, with $R$ the ring of integers of $F$, can be constructed from groups which virtually map onto a non-abelian free group. Along the way we investigate the latter property for congruence subgroups of higher modular groups and its implications for the congruence kernel. This is used to obtain new information on the congruence kernel of the unit group of a group ring.\n  The second aspect concerns the conjugacy classes of the images of finite subgroups of $\\mathcal{U}(R G)$ under the irreducible representations of $G$. More precisely, we initiate the study of a blockwise variant of the Zassenhaus conjectures and the subgroup isomorphism problem. Moreover, we contribute to them for the low rank representations above."}

This concept simultaneously generalizes cluster algebras and semigroup algebras. We show that, under some mild conditions on the singularities, the spectrum $U={\\rm Spec}(R)$ of a mutation semigroup algebra $R$ admits a log Fano compactification $U\\hookrightarrow X$. The compactification $X$ can be chosen to be a $\\mathbb{Q}$-factorial log Fano variety whenever $U$ is $\\mathbb{Q}$-factorial. Furthermore, we prove that a $\\mathbb{Q}$-factorial klt Fano variety $X$ is of cluster type if and only if its Cox ring ${\\rm Cox}(X)$ is a ${\\rm Cl}(X)$-graded mutation semigroup algebra. In order to enlighten the previous theorems, we provide several explicit examples motivated by birational geometry, representation theory, and combinatorics."}

We show that the Harish-Chandra images of the quantum immanants coincide with the factorial Schur $Q$-polynomials."}

We extend several results from abelian categories to triangulated categories, including Reineke inversions, wall-crossing formulas, and Joyce's elements $ε_γ$.

As an application, we characterize all possibilities for stability conditions on $D^b(\\mathrm{rep} A_2)$."}

Equivalently, we show that the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(Σ)$, or the middle cluster algebra $\\mathrm{mid}(\\mathcal{A})$, coincides with the upper cluster algebra $U(Σ)$. Inspired by the work of Shen--Sun--Weng, we introduce the localized cluster variety $\\mathring{\\mathcal{A}}$ as the algebraic version of the decorated Teichmüller space $\\mathcal{T}^d(Σ)$. We show its global section $Γ(\\mathring{\\mathcal{A}},\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathring{\\mathcal{A}}})$ equals the classical Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\\to1}(Σ)$, thereby providing a quantization of $\\mathcal{T}^d(Σ)$ in terms of the Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_q(Σ)$. As a consequence of our geometric characterizations, we deduce normality and the Gorenstein property of the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(Σ)$ and the classical Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\\to1}(Σ)$, as well as finite generation of upper cluster algebra $U(Σ)$."}
