Comments are welcome!", "summary": "We consider the proportion of zero entries in the character table of a sequence of reductive groups over a finite field. We prove an asymptotic lower bound when the reductive group is fixed and the size of the finite field increases. Furthermore, we prove that when considering a sequence of reductive groups with increasing semisimple rank, the proportion is asymptotically one. We also establish an additive analogue of this phenomenon in the context of a fixed reductive Lie algebra."}

Then we examine the case when $S$ is a proper subtorus of a maximal irreducible torus $T$ in the symplectic group and give sufficient conditions on $T$ in order that $S$ never be admissible. When these conditions are not satisfied, we give examples of admissible proper tori of a maximal irreducible torus.\n  Finally, for any admissible subtorus $S$ of a certain type of maximal irreducible torus, we compute the multiplicity of the unitary characters of $S$ appearing into $π_{\\vert S}$. We also show that the multiplicity of such a character is equal to the volume of the symplectic reduction of the inverse image under the momentum map of a linear form associated to it."}

This generalizes the main principle of A. Joyal's proof of Cayley's formula. Finally, we generalize T. Leinster's work by considering a pair of finite-dimensional vector spaces and show a bijectivity between a nilpotent pair of maps and a balanced vector with the hom spaces between them. This leads us to an elegant formula for the number of nilpotent pairs."}

This extends Balmer's classification of radical thick tensor-ideals to noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry. To achieve this, we utilize the notion of support data for lattices and frames, under which the classification follows via Stone duality. We also give a characterization for when the noncommutative Balmer spectrum behaves as it does in tensor-triangular geometry, that is, when it is a spectral space with quasi-compact opens given by complements of supports. Finally, we show that rigid centrally generated monoidal-triangulated categories satisfy this property, and we answer a question posed by Negron--Pevtsova regarding classification of one-sided tensor-ideals via cohomological support."}

We also formalise a theory of polynomial functors as functors which act coherently on all tensor categories. We conclude that the classification of such functors is a different way of posing the above question of which representation of symmetric groups appear. Finally, we extend the classical notion of strict polynomial functors from the category of (super) vector spaces to arbitrary tensor categories, and show that this idea is also a different packaging of the same information."}
