For a general poset the universal category of representations is abelian if and only if for the lattice of ideals the meet of two compact elements is again compact."}

Extended the analysis to include non-Clifford permutations as universal resources for prime and prime-power dimensions", "summary": "The Clifford group is efficiently classically simulable, and universality is obtained by supplementing it with non-Clifford resources. We determine which single-qudit gates suffice to achieve universality. We show that the structure of such resources is governed by the prime factorization of the qudit dimension $d$. Using the adjoint action on the space of complex trace-zero matrices, we relate density to irreducibility together with an infiniteness criterion, yielding a trichotomy based on the factorization of $d$. When $d$ is prime, any non-Clifford gate generates a dense subgroup of the determinant-one unitaries. If $d$ is a prime power, the adjoint action is reducible, and universality requires gates that couple the resulting invariant subspaces. For composite $d$ with pairwise coprime factors, generalized intra-qudit controlled-NOT gates connecting the factors already suffice. These findings suggest that ``composite architectures'' -- hybrid registers combining incommensurate dimensions -- offer a route to bypass the standard overhead associated with magic-state injection."}

Revised version, including a new result on Weyl group symmetry of weight multiplicities (Corollary 1.12)", "summary": "Lusztig varieties are subvarieties in flag manifolds $G/B$ associated to an element $w$ in the Weyl group $W$ and an element $x$ in $G$, introduced in Lusztig's papers on character sheaves. We study the geometry of these varieties when $x$ is regular semisimple.\n  In the first part, we establish that they are normal, Cohen-Macaulay, of pure expected dimension and have rational singularities. We then show that the cohomology of ample line bundles vanishes in positive degrees, in arbitrary characteristic. This extends to nef line bundles when the base field has characteristic zero or sufficiently large characteristic. Along the way, we prove that Lusztig varieties are Frobenius split in positive characteristic and that their open cells are affine. We also prove that the open cells in Deligne-Lusztig varieties are affine, settling a question that has been open since the foundational paper of Deligne and Lusztig.\n  In the second part, we explore their relationship with regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties. Both varieties admit Tymoczko's dot action of $W$ on their (intersection) cohomology. We associate to each element $w$ in $W$ a Hessenberg space using the tangent cone of the Schubert variety associated with $w$, and show that the cohomology of the associated regular semisimple Lusztig varieties and Hessenberg varieties is isomorphic as graded $W$-representations when they are smooth.\n  This relationship extends to the level of varieties: we construct a flat degeneration of regular semisimple Lusztig varieties to regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties. In particular, this proves a conjecture of Abreu and Nigro on the homeomorphism types of regular semisimple Lusztig varieties in type $A$, and generalizes it to arbitrary Lie types."}

(N.S.)10(2015), no.1, 1-72] showed that for a connected reductive group over an algebraic closure of a finite field the associated (geometric) Hecke category admits a truncation in a two-sided Kazhdan--Lusztig cell, making it a categorification of the asymptotic algebra (J-ring), and that the categorical center of this \"asymptotic Hecke category\" is equivalent to the category of unipotent character sheaves supported in the cell. Subsequently, Lusztig noted that an asymptotic Hecke category can be constructed for any finite Coxeter group using Soergel bimodules. Lusztig conjectured that the centers of these categories are modular tensor categories (which was then proven by Elias and Williamson) and that for non-crystallographic finite Coxeter groups the S-matrices coincide with the Fourier matrices that were constructed in the 1990s by Lusztig, Malle, and Broué--Malle. If the conjecture is true, the centers may be considered as categories of \"unipotent character sheaves\" for non-crystallographic finite Coxeter groups.\n  In this paper, we show that the conjecture is true for dihedral groups and for some (we cannot resolve all) cells of H3 and H4. The key ingredient is the method of H-reduction and the identification of the (reduced) asymptotic Hecke category with known categories whose center is already known as well. We conclude by studying the asymptotic Hecke category and its center for some infinite Coxeter groups with a finite cell."}
