In spite of being defined for different values of the parameter $q$, these invariants reflect closely related features in the respective contexts. We show that several new phenomena appear in the quantum case and the representations with non-integral weights contribute to both invariants in a way that cannot be ignored. Building on this, we determine the minimal non-zero value of these invariants for each Lie type. As an application we show that quantum cuspidal modules at generic $q$ can occur only when the underlying semisimple Lie algebra has simple components of type $A$, $B$, or $C$, providing a more explicit representation-theoretic distinction with the classical case."}

As a result, $τ$-tilting theory may be considered to be a special case of tilting theory. This extends the results of Assem-Brüstle-Schiffler-Todorov in the case of hereditary algebras.

In this paper, we mainly study generalized HRS tilting. We first show that an interval of torsion pairs in extriangulated categories with negative first extensions is bijectively associated with torsion pairs in the corresponding heart, which yields several new observations in triangulated categories. Then we obtain a generalization of HRS tilting by replacing hearts of $t$-structures with extended hearts. As an application, we show that certain $t$-structures on triangulated subcategories can be extended to $t$-structures on the whole triangulated categories."}

This notion extends $τ_{[d]}$-tilting pairs of extended finitely generated modules over finite-dimensional algebras to a broader framework, encompassing extended large modules over unitary rings as well as truncated subcategories of finite-dimensional derived categories of proper non-positive differential graded algebras. Within this framework, we establish a bijection between AIR tilting subcategories and silting subcategories. We further define quasi-tilting and tilting subcategories of extended hearts, generalizing the corresponding notions in module categories, and investigate their fundamental properties and the relationships among these three tilting-related concepts."}

It suffices to consider the Lie algebra homology in homological degree one; this vanishes in relative degree 0 and is readily calculated in relative degree 1.\n  This paper calculates the homology in relative degree 2, which presents interesting features.
