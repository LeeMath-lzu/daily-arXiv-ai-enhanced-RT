This result is new in type $\\mathrm{C}$. We also prove that the folding homomorphism, introduced by Hernandez, gives a dimension-preserving bijective correspondence between the finite-dimensional simple representations of untwisted quantum loop algebras of classical simply-laced type and those of the corresponding doubly-twisted quantum loop algebras. This result is new in type $\\mathrm{D}$. In our approach, we develop a bootstrapping method for $q$ and $(q,t)$-characters, based on the freezing operator previously introduced in the context of cluster algebras by the second named author. This method allows us to reduce statements for general simple representations in all classical types to corresponding results on core subcategories in a uniform manner."}
