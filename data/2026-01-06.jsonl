In particular, we find the dual roles of these parameters: as coefficients in quantum cluster algebras and as the central characters of quantum cluster variables. We also provide a geometric method to decompose the space of quantum states into irreducible modules of the Chekhov--Fock algebra.\n  We introduce two versions of quantum intertwiners associated with a mapping class: on the entire representation space and on each irreducible component, each being an explicit composite of cyclic quantum dilogarithm operators. We prove that the former gives an intertwiner of local representations of quantum Teichmüller space in the sense of Bai--Bonahon--Liu [BBL07], and also coincides with the transpose of the reduced quantum hyperbolic operator of Baseilhac--Benedetti [BB18]. The mutation relation of coefficients is equivalent to the quantum gluing equation.
