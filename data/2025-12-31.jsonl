These relations are called the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations. The strategy of the proof of the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations is based on the method of semi-infinite flag manifolds and the Borel-type presentation. In addition, we observe that the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations give a complete set of the defining relations of the quantum $K$-ring. This gives a presentation of the quantum $K$-ring of the flag manifold of type $C$, called the Whitney-type presentation, as a quotient of a polynomial ring, different from the Borel-type presentation."}

Using the classification of Matić and an explicit analysis of Jacquet modules, we describe these duals in terms of precise inducing data. Our results extend known descriptions for classical groups to the metaplectic groups case and clarify the role of Aubert duality for non-linear covering groups, providing a foundation for future applications to the study of unitary representations for those cases. Furthermore, We are able to show that the same method applies to odd general spin groups $GSpin(2n+1)$, yielding an explicit description of Aubert duals in that setting as well."}

The latter describe spectra of closed spin chains with twisted periodic boundary conditions and, upon the duality, the twist elements are identified with the $q$-oper connections on a projective line in a certain gauge. In this work, we initiate the geometric study of Bethe Ansatz equations for spin chains with open boundary conditions. We introduce the space of $q$-opers whose defining sections are invariant under reflection through the unit circle in a selected gauge. The space of such reflection-invariant $q$-opers in the presence of certain nondegeneracy conditions is thereby described by the corresponding Bethe Ansatz problem. We compare our findings with the existing results in integrable systems and representation theory. This paper discusses the type-A construction leaving the general case for the upcoming work."}

Given an inclusion $f:G\\hookrightarrow H$, the Dynkin embedding index $j_f$ is characterized equivalently by the induced maps on $π_3$ and on the canonical generators of $H^3$, $H^4(B{-})$, and $H^4(Σ{-})$. Consequently, $j_f$ controls instanton-number scaling, the quantization levels of Chern--Simons and Wess--Zumino--Witten terms, and the matching of gauge couplings and one-loop RG scales. We connect this picture to representation theory via the $β$-construction in topological $K$-theory, relating Dynkin indices to Chern characters through Harris' degree--$3$ formula and Naylor's suspended degree--$4$ refinement. Finally, we apply these results to F-theory to explain the prevalence of index-one matter: we propose a ``genericity heuristic'' where geometry favors regular embeddings (typically $j_f=1$) associated with minimal singularity enhancements, while higher-index embeddings require non-generic tuning."}

Following a question by Serre, we study the set $\\mathrm{IF}$ of conjugacy classes of integral representations that are conjugates of the given representation over the field. The set $\\mathrm{IF}$ is often called the set of integral forms in the literature. In previous works we have seen that, for a given representation, the set $\\mathrm{IF}$ can be indexed by the vertex set of a suitable subgraph of the Bruhat-Tits tree for the special linear group. In this work, we describe a construction that allows the simultaneous study of the set $\\mathrm{IF}$ over different splitting fields. For this, we devise and use a theory of twisted Galois form of Bruhat-Tits trees. With this tool, we explicitly compute, in most cases, the cardinality of $\\mathrm{IF}$ for the representation of the classical quaternion group of order $8$ studied by Serre, Feit and others, as much as for other similar groups."}

To achieve this, we introduce and study a functor from the category of rational representations of the monoid of $n \\times n$ matrices to the category of finite dimensional representations of $\\mathcal{M}(n)$. We establish two branching rules. Our main results describe graded module structures of orbit harmonics quotients for the rook, partial transformation, and full transformation monoids.

Moreover, the resolution has many lifting properties which we leverage to study the homotopy Lie algebra associated to the pair $(A,A/I)$, which is defined as the cohomology of the PD derivations of this PD dg algebra. Finally we investigate the complete intersection case in more details as well as connect it to the finite generation of the Yoneda algebra."}

We characterize when its completion has an isolated singularity, thereby strengthening the Dao-Takahashi refinement of the Auslander-Huneke-Leuschke-Wiegand theorem. We investigate the ascent and descent of finite and countable syzygy representation type along the canonical map from $R$ to its completion. One consequence is a complete affirmative answer to Schreyer's conjecture. We explore analogues of Chen's questions in the context of finite Cohen-Macaulay representation type over Cohen-Macaulay rings. The main result in this direction shows that if $R$ is Cohen-Macaulay and there are only finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules that are locally free on the punctured spectrum, then either $R$ is a hypersurface or every Gorenstein projective module is projective; moreover, every Gorenstein projective module over the completion of $R$ is a direct sum of finite generated ones. Finally, we study dominant local rings, introduced by Takahashi, under certain finite representation type conditions, and identify a new class of virtually Gorenstein rings."}

Recall that an object in an abelian category is said to be a brick provided its endomorphism ring is a division ring. Simple modules are, of course, bricks, but in case $A$ is connected and not local, there do exist bricks which are not simple. The aim of this survey is to focus the attention to filtrations of modules where all factors are bricks, with bricks being ordered in some definite way.\n  In general, a module category will have many oriented cycles. Recently, Demonet has proposed to look at so-called brick chains in order to deal with a very interesting directedness feature of a module category. These are the orderings of bricks which we will use.\n  This is a survey which relies on recent investigations by a quite large group of mathematicians. We have singled out some important observations and have reordered them in order to obtain a completely self-contained (and elementary) treatment of the relevance of bricks in a module category. (Most of the papers we rely on are devoted to what is called $τ$-tilting theory, but for the results we are interested in, there is no need to deal with $τ$-tilting, or even with the Auslander-Reiten translation $τ$)."}
