This problem is known to be equivalent to determining the spectral radius of the Bell-CHSH operator.\n  To approach this problem, we give a method to approximate orthogonal projections on V by those on finite dimensional subspaces.\n  This method provides an upper bound and a lower bound for the spectral radius of [A,B], which become exact when the matrix representations of P and Q are \"constant-angle one-shifted form\"."}

Second, for $π$ unitary, a quantitative relationship between the GK-dimension of $π$ and the rate of decay of its matrix coefficients. These results are independent of one another and proved in the framework of the Langlands and Zelevinsky classifications."}
