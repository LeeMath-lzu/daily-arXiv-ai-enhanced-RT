Based on their idea and method, we show that the same property holds for any generalized cluster algebra with $y$-variables in an arbitrary semifield. We also present the relations between the $C$-matrices, the $G$-matrices, and the $F$-polynomials of a generalized cluster pattern and those of the corresponding composite cluster pattern."}

We demonstrate that for high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits), the resources required to break this barrier are strictly governed by the number-theoretic structure of the Hilbert space dimension $d$. By analyzing the adjoint action of the Clifford group, we establish a classification of single-qudit universality as a trichotomy. (I) For prime dimensions, the Clifford group is a maximal finite subgroup, and universality is robustly achieved by any non-Clifford gate. (II) For prime-power dimensions, the group structure fragments, requiring tailored diagonal non-Clifford gates to restore irreducibility. (III) Most notably, for composite dimensions with coprime factors, we demonstrate that standard entangling operations alone -- specifically, generalized intra-qudit CNOT gates -- generate the necessary non-Clifford resources to guarantee a dense subgroup of $\\mathrm{SU}(d)$ without explicit diagonal magic injection. Our proofs rely on a new geometric criterion establishing that a subgroup with irreducible adjoint action is infinite if it contains a non-scalar element with projective distance strictly less than $1/2$ from the identity. These results establish that \"coprime architectures\" -- hybrid registers combining subsystems with coprime dimensions -- can sustain universal computation using only classical entangling operations, rendering the explicit injection of magic resources algebraically unnecessary."}

As an example, we establish the existence of almost split sequences ending with finitely presented modules and those starting with finitely copresented modules in the category of all modules over a small endo-local Hom-reflexive category. Specializing to algebras given by (not necessarily finite) quivers with relations, we further investigate when the categories of finitely presented modules, finitely copresented modules and finite dimensional modules have almost split sequences on either or both sides."}

For each such variety, we describe the symplectic leaves and minimal degenerations between them. Using the resulting Hasse diagrams and secondary hyperplane arrangements, we fully classify the quiver varieties up to isomorphism, a step in the problem of classifying all 4d conical symplectic singularities and the (2, 2) case of quiver varieties. As an application, we answer in the negative a question posed by Bellamy, Craw, Rayan, Schedler, and Weiss regarding whether the $G_4$ quotient singularity (or its projective crepant resolutions) can be realised as a quiver variety."}

We identify the islices ${}^\\imath\\overline{W}_μ^λ$ in type AI with suitable nilpotent Slodowy slices of type BCD, building on the work of Lusztig and Mirković-Vybornov in type A. We propose a framework for producing ortho-symplectic (and hybrid) Coulomb branches from split (and nonsplit) Satake framed double quivers, which are conjectured to relate closely to the islices ${}^\\imath\\overline{W}_μ^λ$ and the algebras ${}^\\imath Y_μ^λ$."}

It naturally acts on the space dual to the Lie algebra n of N, and this action is called coadjoint. Such orbits play the key role in the orbit method of A.A. Kirillov. In this work, we classify the orbits of this action in the case of Φ = F_4 in terms of supports of canonical forms. This means that we will present a set S of linear forms such that for any coadjoint orbit there exists a unique form from S belonging to that orbit. The set of canonical forms will be explicitly described in terms of supports."}
