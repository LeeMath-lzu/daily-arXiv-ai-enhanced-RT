Following an idea of Nakajima, we give a sheaf theoretic interpretation of critical stable envelopes by the hyperbolic restriction in the affinization of symmetric quiver varieties. The associativity of hyperbolic restrictions implies the triangle lemma of critical stable envelopes."}

It generalizes orbit mutations arising from quiver coverings and allows for infinite mutation sequences even when orbit mutations are obstructed. We further construct quivers with homotopies from triangulations of marked surfaces with colored punctures, and prove that flips correspond to mutations, extending the Fomin-Shapiro-Thurston model to the setting with 2-cycles."}

We show that this action is $2$-transitive on standard Young tableaux of the shape $λ$ if and only if $λ$ is not self-transpose and not a single hook. Moreover, we show that in these cases, the image of the cactus group in the permutation group of standard Young tableaux is either the whole permutation group or the alternating group, and prove that both cases are possible for infinitely many $λ$ (though the alternating group is more frequent). As an application, this implies that the Galois group of solutions to the Bethe ansatz in the Gaudin model attached to the Lie group $GL_d$ is, in many cases, at least the alternating group. This also extends the results of Sottile and White on the multiple transitivity of the Galois group of Schubert calculus problems in Grassmannians to many new cases."}

We use them to parametrise a family of thick subcategories of the compact objects, which we call radical. These spaces can be viewed as non-monoidal analogues of the Balmer and homological spectra arising in tensor-triangular geometry: we prove that for monogenic tensor-triangulated categories the Balmer spectrum is a subspace of the shift-spectrum. To construct these analogues we utilise quotients of the module category, rather than the lattice theoretic methods which have been adopted in other approaches. We characterise radical thick subcategories and show in certain cases, such as the perfect derived categories of tame hereditary algebras or monogenic tensor-triangulated categories, that every thick subcategory is radical. We establish a close relationship between the shift-homological spectrum and the set of irreducible integral rank functions, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for every radical thick subcategory to be given by an intersection of kernels of rank functions. In order to facilitate these results, we prove that both spaces we introduce may equivalently be described in terms of the Ziegler spectrum."}
