The practical aims to deepen students' understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing by implementing quantum circuit simulators. Through hands-on experience, students learn about different methods to simulate quantum computing, including state vectors, density matrices, the stabilizer formalism, and matrix product states. By implementing the simulation methods themselves, students develop a more in-depth understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing, including superposition, entanglement, and the effects of noise on quantum systems. This hands-on experience prepares students to do research in the field of quantum computing and equips them with the knowledge and skills necessary to tackle complex research projects in the field. In this work, we describe our teaching approach and the structure of our practical, and we discuss evaluations and lessons learned."}

In this paper, we consider the Berezin-Toeplitz deformation quantization and obtain the following global results concerning the asymptotic action of Berezin-Toeplitz operators on $H^0(X, L^{\\otimes k})$:\n  (1). For a general smooth function $f \\in C^\\infty(X)$, we prove that the Berezin-Toeplitz operators $T_{f,k}$ are asymptotic to differential operators acting on $H^0(X, L^{\\otimes k})$ as $k \\to \\infty$. An immediate consequence is their asymptotic locality.\n  (2). If $f \\in C^\\infty(X)$ is furthermore the symbol of a level $k$ quantizable function, then we prove that the associated Berezin-Toeplitz operators $T_{f,k}$ are all holomorphic differential operators. Conversely, Berezin-Toeplitz operators that are holomorphic differential operators all arise in this way. This gives a complete characterization of when Berezin-Toeplitz operators are holomorphic differential operators.\n  To prove these results, we construct higher order analgoues of Kostant-Souriau's pre-quantum differential operators using our Fedosov-type constructions in previous works, establish new orthogonality relations which generalize the classical Tuynman's Lemma, and employ various differential-geometric and analytic technqiues such as Hörmander's estimates."}

More generally, we can consider an algebraic quantum group $(A,Δ)$. We use the term here for a regular multiplier Hopf algebra with integrals. For $B$ we now take the dual $\\widehat A$ of $A$. It is again an algebraic quantum group. In this case, the duality gives rise to an element $V$ in the multiplier algebra $M(B\\otimes A)$. Still, most of the properties of $V$ in the finite-dimensional case are true in this more general setting. The focus in this paper lies on various aspects of the duality between $A$ and its dual $\\widehat A$. Among other things we include a number of formulas relating the objects associated with an algebraic quantum group and its dual. This note is meant to give a comprehensive, yet concise (and sometimes simpler) account of these known results. This is part I of a series of three papers on this subject. The case of a multiplier Hopf $^*$-algebra with positive integrals is treated in detail in part II and part III."}

Furthermore, we give a complete classification of this type by a combinatorial method of real weighted quivers. However, the sign-coherence of real $C$-, $G$-matrices does not always hold in general. For this purpose, we classify all the rank $2$ case and the finite type case via the Coxeter diagrams. We also give two conjectures about the real exchange matrices and $C$-, $G$-matrices.
