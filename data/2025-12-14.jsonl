We first prove that when $q$ is not a root of unity, the global homological dimension of $\\mathfrak{h}_n(q)$ is exactly $3n$, while it becomes infinite when $q$ is a root of unity. We then demonstrate the rigidity of its iterated Ore extension structure, showing that any such presentation is essentially unique up to permutation and scaling of variables. The graded automorphism group is completely determined to be isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{C}^*)^{2n} \\rtimes S_n$. Furthermore, $\\mathfrak{h}_n(q)$ is shown to possess a universal deformation property as the canonical PBW-preserving deformation of the classical Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_n(1)$. We compute its Hilbert series as $(1-t)^{-3n}$, confirming polynomial growth of degree $3n$, and establish that its Gelfand--Kirillov dimension coincides with its classical Krull dimension. These results are extended to a generalized multi-parameter version $\\mathfrak{H}_n(\\mathbf{Q})$, and illustrated through detailed examples and applications in representation theory and deformation quantization."}

The result is obtained for the Poisson transform studied by Knapp-Wallach under the name Szegö map, and the appropriate Sobolev spaces are defined using van Erp-Yuncken's Heisenberg calculus. The proof generalizes to show that commutators of this Poisson transform with smooth functions on the Furstenberg compactification are compact. This proves the remaining open conjecture in Julg's seminal program to establish the Baum-Connes conjecture for closed subgroups of semisimple Lie groups of real rank one."}

First, we confirm Halpern-Leistner's conjecture on the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks admitting proper good moduli spaces, extending Davison's work on the moduli stack of objects in $2$-Calabi--Yau categories. Second, we prove versions of Kirwan surjectivity for the critical cohomology of symmetric $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks and for the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks. Finally, by applying our main result to the character stacks associated with compact oriented $3$-manifolds, we reduce the quantum geometric Langlands duality conjecture for $3$-manifolds, as formulated by Safronov, from an isomorphism between infinite-dimensional critical cohomologies to a comparison of finite-dimensional BPS cohomologies."}

In particular this duality relates their Hochschild cohomologies, autoequivalence groups, and semiorthogonal decompositions. We establish reflexivity in a variety of settings including affine schemes, simple-minded collections, chain and cochain dg algebras of topological spaces, Ginzburg dg algebras, and Fukaya categories of cotangent bundles and surfaces as well as the closely related class of graded gentle algebras. Our proofs are based on the interplay of reflexivity with gluings, derived completions, and Koszul duality. In particular we show that for certain (co)connective dg algebras, reflexivity is equivalent to derived completeness."}

Starting from 3d abelian Chern-Simons theory, we construct an ensemble of boundary CFTs defined by gauging all possible maximal subgroups of the bulk one-form symmetry. Each maximal non-anomalous subgroup is isomorphic to a classical even self-dual error-correcting code over $\\mathbb Z_p\\times \\mathbb Z_p$, providing a way to define a boundary \"code CFT.\" The average over the ensemble of such theories is holographically dual to Chern-Simons gravity, a bulk theory summed over 3d topologies sharing the same boundary. In the case of prime $p$, the sum reduces to that over handlebodies, i.e. becomes the Poincaré series akin to that in semiclassical gravity. As the main result of the paper, we show that the mathematical identity underlying this holographic duality can be understood and rigorously proven using the framework of Howe duality over finite fields. This framework is concerned with the representation theory of two commuting groups forming a dual pair: the symplectic group of modular transformations of the boundary, and an orthogonal group mapping codes to each other. Finally, we reformulate the holographic duality as an identity between different averages over quantum stabilizer states, providing an interpretation in terms of quantum information theory."}

This yields an unconditional construction of the motivic perverse filtration for the Hitchin system, which lifts the cohomological/sheaf-theoretic perverse filtration. (b) We prove that the inverse of the relative Hard Lefschetz symmetry is induced by a relative algebraic correspondence, confirming the relative Lefschetz standard conjecture for the Hitchin system.
