We establish their existence and define their orthogonality relations. When specialized to Kolb and Letzter's quantum symmetric pair coideal subalgebras, we associate, to each classical commutative triple, a unique corresponding quantum commutative triple. This leads to families of vector-valued orthogonal polynomials, which diagonalize a commutative algebra of difference-reflection operators and are invariant under sending $q \\mapsto q^{-1}$. Various examples of these vector-valued orthogonal polynomials are given and identified with Intermediate Macdonald polynomials"}

We consider the general addition formula in the determinant form and take a certain limit of it. It expresses certain shifts of a tau function in terms of the Wronskian determinants of wave functions at various values of the spectral parameter. As an application the relation between solutions created by vertex operators and those created by Darboux transformations is clarified. As another application the new addition formula for Riemann's theta functions of Riemann surfaces is obtained by considering theta function solutions of the KP hierarchy. This addition formula is different from any of formulas in Fay's book."}

This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse.\n  We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \\leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge.\n  We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \\mod 2)$ for all $n \\geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions."}

Total trades were introduced recently by Ghorbani, Kamali and Khosravshahi, who showed that over a field of characteristic zero the vector space of trades decomposes into a direct sum of spaces of total trades. In this paper, we show that the vector space spanned by the permutations of a total trade is an irreducible representation of the symmetric group. As a corollary, the previous decomposition theorem is recovered. Also, a basis is obtained for the module of total trades in the spirit of Specht polynomials. More generally, in the second part of the paper we consider intersection matrices and determine the irreducible decompositions of their images. This generalizes previously known results concerning ranks of special cases."}

In this paper, we explore the properties of maximal commuting families of i-boxes in a more general setting, and define a certain matrix associated with such a family, which we call the exchange matrix. It turns out that, when considering the cluster algebra structure on the Grothendieck rings, this matrix is indeed the exchange matrix of the seed associated with the family, both in certain categories of modules over quantum affine algebras and over quiver Hecke algebras. We prove this by constructing explicit short exact sequences that represent the mutation relations."}
