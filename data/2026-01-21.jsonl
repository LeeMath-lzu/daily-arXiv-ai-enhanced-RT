We show that the classification of these representations reduces to the finite case, as they all factorise through some finite quotient SO(3)$_p$ mod $p^k$. Then, we tackle the problem of $p$-adic qubit composition and entanglement, fundamental for a $p$-adic formulation of quantum information processing. We classify the representations of SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$, and analyse tensor products of two $p$-adic qubit representations lifted from SO(3)$_p$ mod $p$. We solve the Clebsch-Gordan problem for such systems, revealing that the coupled bases decompose into singlet and doublet states. We further study entanglement arising from those stable subsystems.

Following similar ideas as in quasimaps to Nakajima quiver varieties studied by the Okounkov school, we analyse vertex functions in several examples, including Hilbert schemes of points on $\\mathbb{C}^3$, moduli spaces of perverse coherent systems on the resolved conifold, and a quiver which defines higher $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$-spin chains. Bethe equations are calculated in these cases.\n  The construction in the present paper is based on the theory of gauged linear sigma models as well as shifted symplectic geometry of Pantev, Toën, Vaquie and Vezzosi, and uses the virtual pullback formalism of symmetric obstruction theory of Park, which arises from the recent development of Donaldson-Thomas theory of Calabi-Yau 4-folds."}

Unlike the finite-dimensional case, an affine Kac--Moody algebra may contain proper subalgebras isomorphic to itself, such as winding subalgebras obtained by rescaling the loop parameter. We investigate the restriction of integrable highest-weight representations to such subalgebras. The restriction remains integrable and decomposes into irreducible components with finite multiplicities, encoded by pairs of highest weights. We show that this set is closed under addition, extending a result of Brion and Knop to the affine setting. We also give a partial description of this set and provide explicit results for types $A^{(1)}_1$ and $A^{(2)}_2$."}
